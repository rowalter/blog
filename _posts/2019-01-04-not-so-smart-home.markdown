I recently outfitted my house with the Alexa and Google Assistant ecosystem. I bought Amazon Echo devices, the Google Home Hub, and a number of accessories like smart lights, switches, and plugs. I also connected the two to my existing thermostat.

What went well:
- Setup for the individual devices was relatively straightforward. Once I logged in with my Gmail account, the Google Home hub was instantly useful - pulling in my photos, music preferences, location, news and other things.
- Sound quality in the Echo Dot is surprisingly good for it's size. 

What didn't go well:
- When it desn't work, it's extremely frustrating. I setup a routine for our kids bathtime. 
- Audio Input - Both Google Home and Echo Dot consistently have trouble picking up my commands. Especially if there's any background noise - I often find myself yelling at the devices.
- Female Voices - I find the Google Home in particular has a hard time with female voices. My wife finds the Google doesn't respond as well to her to it's invoking command "Okay Google" or "Hey Google".
- Another Hub Needed for Smartlights. 
- Usability for Routines.

Feature Requests:
- A Whisper Mode
- Multitasking in the Google Home Hub - You cannot run a timer
