There's been some interesting [discussion](https://twitter.com/bgurley/status/1083756889089798145) on Twitter recently about venture capital. Specifically around how most companies should not be taking VC at all.

These are some disconnected thoughts on the relationship between startups and venture capital. These are in context of a single company (vs. the role of venture in an entrepreneurial ecosystem, which I'll write about later).

* Venture Capital is a form of equity financing, reserved for high-risk-high-reward investments. VC firms raise money LP's which include pension funds, endowment funds, family offices. These are often part of an LP's high risk investment buckets. It's important to understand this as a company accepting VC. You are part of a broader system of fiduciary responsibility, and this will influence the dynamics between a VC and individual company.
* As a high risk investment, it is binary - most investments will fail to realize any returns, but the ones that hit will more than make up for those failures. This binary outcome is baked into the deal - for both good situations and bad. In the latter, there is specific protection for VC's to recoup any value if a company is sold for parts. 
* Venture is appropriate when a _sudden_ influx of cash has a high likelihood of accelerating a business' chances for capturing a market. This is when a business has found product market fit, is ready to scale, and there is significant _room_ for growth (i.e. the market is big). It goes without saying that founders also have to _want_ to capture that entire market.
* Most companies fit some but not all of these criteria. This is totally fine and those companies likely don't need VC to grow, or nearly as much as they think. An influx of cash almost always leads to poor decision-making when it's not focused.
* This combination of factors is rare and most companies don't fit this criteria. When it does happen a company likely doesn't _need_ technically venture capital to survive - making it the best time to raise. 
* Tech companies and VC often go hand in hand, mostly because of the high leverage and distribution potential of the Internet. But just because it's an internet company, doesn't make it _venture scale_.
* When a company raises, what is immediately established is the governance structure to guide the company through it's growth phase. 
* Too much capital and not enough companies means that the dollars and expectations of a VC investment are poured into companies that are simply not ready for it yet. It seems we may be here today. It's easy to blame the VC here, but it's a two way street.
* You cannot blame VC when founders are going into deals with their eyes wide open. No one is forcing anyone to take their money. When it is taken, there is a value exchange and expectation. This value exchange in the form of equity (percentage ownership). It comes with well established governance structures that also may not be appropriate for all companies - but are necessary when navigating high growth very quickly.
* Venture has played a critical role in developing the most valuable companies on the planet today. The availability of venture capital in an ecosystem can motivate founders to start companies that swing for the fences.
