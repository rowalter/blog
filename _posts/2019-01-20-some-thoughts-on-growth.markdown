I will be at the Founder Institute tomorrow discussing the growth practice at startups. I'm using this as a chance to get my thoughts together on the topic. 

* The nature of growth has changed a lot in the last few years. There is so much more information, advice, and stories from the frontline. 
* Growth from a product lens - Mental models for growth - ecosystems, flywheels and funnels - channel strategy
* Growth from a team lens - comes from everywhere, what does it mean to have everyone thinking about it 
* know why people use your product
* Growth and it's impacts. Second order effects.
* Growth in new platforms (ride on novelty and growth of platform itself). Growth in existing platforms (ride on mature channels, paid Acq,  competition) 
*
