One of the biggest challenges I’ve found in developing a [writing habit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-27-starting-a-new-habit %}) is choosing what to write about. While there is no shortage of ideas, choosing between them has been challenging. So, I’m going to try to start theming my writing based on the Day of the week. Some of my favourite bloggers do the same - [Fred Wilson](http://www.avc.com) and [Albert Wenger](http://www.continuations.com). 

So, here’s a tentative list of the theme days. Hopefully this reduces the burden of choice and just like building a writing habit itself, puts certain parts of the process on autopilot. 

* Mental Model Mondays, to write about specific models and frameworks that I've found repeatedly useful. 
* Productivity Tuesdays, in which I’ll discuss topics centered around the theme of personal betterment and productivity.
* Leadership Wednesday, where I’ll write about topics related to management. I'll likely use the same [latticework]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-29-mental-models-for-leadership %}) to structure topics here. 
* Code Thursday, in which I’ll write about topics around developments in the software industry and it's impact on society.
* Finance Friday, where I'll write about all things related to building financial literacy and investing - an area of personal interest.

On the weekends, I’ll leave it open to other topics. This might be too much structure already but I'm looking forward to reducing some burden of choice, and just write. I’m not sure. Let’s see.
