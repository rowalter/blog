One of the biggest challenges I’ve found in developing a [writing habit](http://tarunsachdeva.com/blog/frameworks/2018/08/28/start-a-new-habit.html) is choosing what to write about. While there is no shortage of ideas, choosing between them has been challenging. So, I’m going to try to start theming my writing based on the Day of the week. Some of my favourite bloggers do the same - [Fred Wilson](http://www.avc.com) and [Albert Wenger](http://www.continuations.com). 

So, here’s a tentative list of the theme days. Hopefully this reduces the burden of choice and just like building a writing habit itself, puts certain parts of the process on autopilot. 

* Leadership Mondays, in which I’ll discuss topics around management and leadership in a software startup based on experience and learning.
* Productivity Tuesdays, in which I’ll discuss topics centered around the theme of personal betterment and productivity.
* Tech Saturday, in which I’ll write about topics around the building software and my perspectives on how technology is changing our society.

On the other days, I’ll leave it open to other topics. This might be too much structure already but I'm looking forward to reducing some burden of choice, and just write. I’m not sure. Let’s see.
