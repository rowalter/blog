There's been some uproar online about the People's Party billboards that popped up in Toronto recently, decrying mass immigration. It's disgusting but not surprising; Canada is not immune to blatant state-sponsored racism.

My experience is the immigrant experience, but probably not the typical one. I've gone through so many visas and statuses I've lost count.

I came to Canada in 1997 on a diplomatic visa, and started school at the University of Waterloo. I transferred to a student visa, and also did a number of co-op terms in the United States (on a J1 training visa) at Amazon.com in Seattle. I had all intentions of moving to the US. But, the visa for my last co-op term wasn't granted because the Embassy deemed I had spent "too many terms" in the US, and needed to go back to my country of citizenship (India) to "apply my training" for atleast two years.
