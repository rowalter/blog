This is the second in a series of posts about how decentralization takes place in marketplaces - through an erosion of trust in intermediaries. In my [first post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-08-18-marketplaces-decentralization-trust-supply-side %}), I examined how trust breaks down in suppliers and what that causes.

Customers losing trust happens when the marketplace no longer offers the level of convenience (through price or selection), or doesn't invest in improving the fulfillment experience of a product or service sold in the marketplace. This is generally a slower process - one bad experience will not mean a customer writes off the marketplaces; but over time dissatisfaction can compound.

Additionally, supplier mistreatment creates a side effect of lost trust with customers. This is true especially in today's ecosystem where customers are more discerning about the goods and services they consume. 

The opportunity here is to help customers manage their relationships
