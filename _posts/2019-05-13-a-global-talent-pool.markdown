Restricting talent to a local candidate pool isn't a sustainable way to build a company. It's impossible not to look outside a city especially in a competitive hiring environment like today. Remote-only organizations are becoming more common, and companies have to start building cultures where remote workers can thrive.

So what does it mean to do business in a global talent pool? Some considerations:

- Hiring and firing becomes infinitely easier and more difficult. Finding the best people globally means there's an opportunity for the meritocracy myth to actually be true - but  the right person is the needle in a haystack. 
- Helping create team dynamics in a global talent pool is extremely difficult. This is a common challenge with remote work - they can feel isolated and teams may not feel as cohesive. 
- There's an additional overhead investment to make remote successful. This can include operational issues like knowledge management. 

An organization is a group of individuals and people that choose to spend a part of their career journey towards company goals. A global talent pool affects all parts of that system.
