For the last few weeks, every post has been a struggle to compose. After crossing  185 posts - actually, a few earlier - I reached the "what's the point?" point. 

I don't know if I can keep writing everyday.

But I'm not sure if this is a real break. I wanted to acknowledge this feeling by, well, putting it in writing. I'm here, asking myself - what are these words adding up to? Why abide so strictly to this self created rule of writing everyday?

Today, I'm asking myself - what's the point of this writing? But tomorrow, I hope I won't be.
