Tech Twitter is buzzing about the [Away article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995453/away-luggage-ceo-steph-korey-toxic-work-environment-travel-inclusion) today. What's happening there is pretty inexcusable. And what's happening on Twitter is a bit gross too. Not sure there's any better way to change behaviour like this without shining a big bright light, I suppose. Company building is not easy and this will likely have some very positive intended consequences for employees at Away - but I fear about the unintended negative effects.
