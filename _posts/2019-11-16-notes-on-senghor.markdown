I'm slow reading [What You Do is Who You Are](https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are-ebook/dp/B07NVN4QCM) by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section. This post is about the chapter on Shaka Senghor who spent 20 years incarcerated and led change within that culture of violence. 

Senghor's story is long and one of the most interesting chapters in the book.
