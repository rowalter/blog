Some personal news for the new year.

A few weeks ago I ended the most rewarding chapter of my career at Wattpad, after almost 8 years. 

In a few days, I'll be moving to New York City and starting a role at Endeavor, the entertainment and sports powerhouse, as SVP & GM of their education business.
