Software is like plastic - it started off trying to mimic something, and now has become something in it's own right.

Infact, it is becoming _everything_. It is eating the world, and we are rushing to become closer to it.

It is clear we are hurtling towards a world where software will be everywhere and in everything. So much so that it will become invisible. 

In this essay, I want to examine:
- Who will create it? Will software be made by many or the few?
- How will we value it? Will we consider it real? Will we go back?
- What happens when we create too much software? What is the software equivalent of the plastic pacific garbage patch?







I re-read one of my favorite essays recently - [What Screens Want](https://frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/) by Frank Chimero. Calling it an essay doesn't do it justice - it's an entertaining combination of words, images and video.

There's one analogy from it that I've always wanted to examine further - of how **software has become like plastic**. This quote is an [excerpt](https://vimeo.com/79718420) from a BBC show from the 60's called _Connections_. 

> I mean, early on, if you made something in plastic, you had to make it look exactly like what it was replacing. I mean particularly leather, or people wouldnâ€™t buy it. 

The plastic industry started by trying to mimic other materials - faux leather, wood grain, etc. And then we started making things that could only be made by plastic. It has the unique property of being able to _become anything_. Now, almost everything around us is made of plastic and we almost don't even use the term plastic anymore. It has become everything. 

Software is the same. Software started of full of metaphors, but is now native.

It is closing in on us, and we are rushing to bring it even closer. We will live in it, we wear it, and eventually will become everything.

So what happens when software becomes everything?

When plastic ate everything - consumer, industrial, it became a commodity. Will the same thing happen to software? Will we relegate software

One key difference is that making things with plastic wasn't ever accessible - before the 3d printer, that is. Software is the opposite. 

Accessible / Useful in day to day to Inaccessible (because of AI??) - only a few people can really use it - Google and DowDuPont comparison 

Where will the VALUE go? 

Are we in the play dough phase of software? 

If anything is really useful it will get copied by the big guys. Applies in the world of plastic and software. 

What happens when we create too much of it. Clutter of software? What will he pacific garbage patch of software look like??? 

Software is an unbounded entity - doesn't feel tangible.
