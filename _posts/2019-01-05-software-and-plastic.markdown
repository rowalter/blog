One of my favorite essays is "What Screens Want" by Frank Chimero.

- Software is like plastic. 
- The plastic industry started by trying to mimic other materials - faux leather, wood grain, etc. And then we started making things that could only be made by plastic. It has the unique property of being able to _become anything_. Now, almost everything around us is made of plastic.

Software is the same. Software started of full of metaphors, but is now native.

It is closing in on us, and we are rushing to bring it even closer. We will live in it, we wear it, and eventually will become everything.

So what happens when software becomes everything?
