One of my favorite essays is "What Screens Want" by Frank Chimero.

- Software is like plastic. 
- The plastic industry started by trying to mimic other materials - faux leather, wood grain, etc. And then we started making things that could only be made by plastic. It has the unique property of being able to _become anything_. Now, almost everything around us is made of plastic.

Software is the same. Software started of full of metaphors, but is now native.

It is closing in on us, and we are rushing to bring it even closer. We will live in it, we wear it, and eventually will become everything.

So what happens when software becomes everything?

When plastic ate everything - consumer, industrial, it became a commodity. Will the same thing happen to software? Will we relegate software

One key difference is that making things with plastic wasn't ever accessible - before the 3d printer, that is. Software is the opposite. 

Accessible / Useful in day to day to Inaccessible (because of AI??) - only a few people can really use it - Google and DowDuPont comparison 

Where will the VALUE go? 

Are we in the play dough phase of software? 

If anything is really useful it will get copied by the big guys. Applies in the world of plastic and software. 

What happens when we create too much of it. Clutter of software? What will he pacific garbage patch of software look like??? 

Software is an unbounded entity - doesn't feel tangible.
