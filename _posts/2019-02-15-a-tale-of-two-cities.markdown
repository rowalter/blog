A very short post today.

There are two similar stories that dominated my feed today. Amazon's [reversal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/nyregion/amazon-hq2-nyc.html) to build HQ2 in New York, and Sidewalk's [leaked plans](https://betakit.com/leaked-documents-reveal-sidewalk-labs-wants-a-lot-more-than-quayside/) to build more than initially stated in it's Quayside proposal. 

I live around the corner from Quayside so that story is particularly alarming. I have no problem with Sidewalk as a concept, but it has created the problems it's facing. Amazon seems to as well, because the whole search was a ridiculous affair.

Technology is a part of almost everything we do, and technology companies cannot operate under their own self made rules and visions. Whether it's through regulation, dialogue with the public, or other means - we need to rebuild the broken trust between tech companies and society. This will take years of intentional effort on the part of the entire industry.
