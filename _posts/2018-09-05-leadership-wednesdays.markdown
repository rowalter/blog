I'm kicking off **Leadership Wednesday (LW)** with following up on the domains of responsibilty outlined in [developing a leadership latticework]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-29-developing-leadership-latticework %}). This learning framework is simply an outline of the areas for which leaders are either directly responsible or accountable.

As a refresher, the domains of responsibility outlined were:

* Individual Domain, concerned with the people at an individual level 
* Organization Domain, concerned with how people organize to work together
* Output Domain, concerned with what is actually being created (can be divided into functional groups like code, design, sales, or broader outputs, like the decisions). 
* Ecosystem Domain, concerned with the customers, markets and environment in which you're operating. Major strategic decisions will fall into this domain. 
* Impact Domain, concerned with the broader impacts of what's being created

In following weeks, I'll be examining each domain by detailing:

* Responsibility Scopes within the domain: I'll dive into detail of each domain and cover the scope of responsibility. For example, in the Individual domain, the responsibilities of concern include understanding people and their strengths, managing their career journey, effectively providing feedback, etc.
* Practices: This outlines the specific practices of the domain - a more tactical view of the previous section. For example, the practice of 1:1's, creating growth plans, how to fire people - etc. Some of these are battle tested, others are somewhat experimental. 
* Frameworks: Here I'll cover some of the frameworks that I've picked up along the way that have helped me in the practices above. The sources of these frameworks come from everywhere - experience, blog posts, books. 
* Other Resources: Specific people, authors, books or websites I've found to be a great source of information related to this domain of leadership.

As I come across new sources of knowledge, this framework has helped me file things away, compare one technique to another, or just simply clarify what the job actually is. I want to emphasize that this is my personal framework of _learning_. Hopefully, the structure can be useful to someone other than myself as well.

Next week, I'll cover the Individual Domain, which is concerned with management at an individual level.
