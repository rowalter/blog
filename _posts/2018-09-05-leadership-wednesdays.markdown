I'm kicking off **Leadership Wednesday (LW)** with an outline of the domains of responsibilty in [developing a leadership practice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-29-developing-leadership-practice %}).

Given leadership roles have a massive surface area of accountability, a framework that outlines the expanse makes the learning easier to manage (and quicker). This learning framework is simply an outline of the areas for which leaders are either directly responsible or accountable.

* Individual Domain, concerned with the people at an individual level 
* Team Domain, concerned with how people organize to work together
* Products, concerned with what is actually being created or offered
* Markets, concerned with how those products are received by customers
* Society, concerned with the broader impact of those products

For each domain, I'll break this further into:

* Responsibility Scopes: So much of learning about leadership is a clear articulation of the scope of the role, which I'll cover here. For example, in the Individual domain, the responsibilities of concern include understanding people and their strengths, managing their career journey, effectively providing feedback, etc.
* Practices: This outlines the specific practices of the domain - a more tactical view of the previous section. For example, the practice of 1:1's, creating growth plans, how to fire people - etc. Some of these are battle tested, others are somewhat experimental.
* Frameworks: Here I'll cover some of the frameworks that I've picked up along the way that have helped me in the practices above. The sources of these frameworks come from everywhere - experience, blog posts, books.
* Other Resources: Specific people, authors, books or websites I've found to be a great source of information related to this domain of leadership.

I want to clarify and emphasize - Leadership Wednesday is a way for me to articulate my personal framework of "learning leadership". Hopefully, the structure can be useful to someone other than myself as well. 

Next week, we'll cover the domain of the Individual, which is concerned with managing at an individual level. Stay tuned!
