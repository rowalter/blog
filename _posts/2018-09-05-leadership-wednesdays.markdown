I'm kicking off **Leadership Wednesday (LW)** with an in-depth outline of each domain of leadership responsibilty outlined in the [mental models for leadership](http://tarunsachdeva.com/blog/leadership/2018/08/29/mental-models-for-leadership.html) post.

For the next few weeks, I'll be examining each of the domains for which a leader is responsible:
* Individuals 
* Teams 
* Products
* Markets
* Society

For each domain, I'll break this further into:

* Responsibility Scopes: So much of learning about leadership is a clear articulation of the scope of the role, which I'll cover here. For example, in the Individual domain, the responsibilities of concern include understanding people and their strengths, managing their career journey, effectively providing feedback, etc.
* Practices: This outlines the specific practices of the domain - a more tactical view of the previous section. For example, the practice of 1:1's, creating growth plans, how to fire people - etc. Some of these are battle tested, others are somewhat experimental.
* Frameworks: Here I'll cover some of the frameworks that I've picked up along the way that have helped me in the practices above. The sources of these frameworks come from everywhere - experience, blog posts, books.
* Other Resources: Specific people, authors, books or websites I've found to be a great source of information related to this domain of leadership.

I want to clarify and emphasize - Leadership Wednesday is a way for me to articulate my personal framework of "learning leadership". Given leadership roles have a massive surface area of accountability, a framework that outlines the expanse makes the learning easier to manage (and quicker). Hopefully, the structure can be useful to someone other than myself as well. 

Next week, we'll cover the domain of the Individual, which is concerned with managing at an individual level. Stay tuned!
