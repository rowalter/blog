Everything is sales.
Every time you launch a product or service, you’re selling to your customer.

Sales is listening.

It’s about knowing you customer.

It’s knowing what your customer wants and needs.

It’s matching that with a solution that addresses these wants and needs.

A value proposition is a statement or visualization of your customer’s problem and your solution.
