Decentralization is the foundational mental model of the blockchain. 

The blockchain is a distributed open database (called a ledger).

The ledger has some unique properties:
* It is open and distributed
* Can record information between two parties directly (no intermediary)
* Information cannot be altered

This means a few things:

* **There is no intermediate party required to conduct a digital transaction or interaction.** Today, all of our interactions and transactions are done through _centralized_ services like Google, Facebook, Amazon and the like. These companies provide the convenience of services like social networking and search. In exchange, they collect for user data which is then used to sell hyper targeted advertising or other purposes. There is an implict trust placed on these services, the second order effects of which we're starting to see unfold in various ways. 

** Value in the protocol vs. the application


How will it get used?

- Look at what's broken today?
- Look at unique opportunities it unlocks
