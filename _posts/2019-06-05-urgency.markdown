It's 11:50 pm. That gives me 10 minutes to write and publish a post that I haven't even conceived yet.

But for some reason, I'm not worried.

10 minutes is also 600 seconds, a unit shift that adds a different perspective. Some funny math starts to happen - If the fastest person in the world can run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, in 600 seconds they can run 6000 meters. Obviously this isn't true, but it creates abundance from scarcity. This brings peace of mind and focus.





Time and perspective.
Clarity that comes from urgency.
How this can be extrapolated - and whether it should.
