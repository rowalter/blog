Amazon just bought Eero - the maker of the popular home mesh wifi hardware. 

Not a lot was revealed of the acquisition, especially how Alexa and Eero would integrate. From the [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190211005750/en/Amazon-Acquire-eero-Customers-Connect-Smart-Home):

> By joining the Amazon family, weâ€™re excited to learn from and work closely with a team that is defining the future of the home, accelerate our mission, and bring Eero systems to more customers around the globe. 

I can see a world where Alexa is built into all Eero hubs, and Eero hubs become the smartphone hub of choice (vs hubs by Sengled or other smart device manufacturers). 

I can also imagine the opposite - Eero technology is built into every Echo device, and is an additional value proposition for buying Echo devices. 

This acquisition makes a lot of sense for Amazon on a number of levels. I'm looking forward to seeing how it evolves.
