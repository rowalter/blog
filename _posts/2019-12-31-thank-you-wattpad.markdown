On the last day of the decade, I thought it would be appropriate to write about the place where I spent the better part of it - Wattpad. It has by far been the most rewarding chapter of my career. 

Some of the lessons 

Individuals: Understand yourself  - bottoms up thinking
Teams: Working Together, Relationships are Everything; Win Together, Lose Together
Building Products: Our Compounding and Habits
Markets: Winning matters
Impact: A higher responsibility
