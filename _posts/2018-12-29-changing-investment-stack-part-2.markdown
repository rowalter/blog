In the [first part]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-28-changing-investment-stack %}) of this series, I detailed my move from a financial advisor to an independent brokerage, focusing on the account setup and asset transfer. In this part, I detail the steps I followed to change my investment strategy.

**Step 1: Understanding Your Current Strategy and Allocation**

**Step 2: A Lot of Research and Reading**

**Step 3: Setup Your New Target Asset Allocation**

Your asset allocation is the reflection of your investment strategy. It answers what percentage of your money do you want in a specific asset class - most likely a mix between equity (stocks), fixed income, cash or some others. 

In my particular case, I was moving away from an advisor _and_ changing my investment strategy, so I did my new asset allocation early. This was done in a simple Google spreadsheet where I could adjust percentages across asset classes until I found a comfortable balance. 

Your investments will change over time, as will your allocation.
