Compounding is a powerful force. The underlying concept (I like the simple framing _[growth on your previous growth](https://medium.com/@jaymehoffman/7-mental-models-i-live-my-life-by-e79742d4f074)_). Continual investments over time amplify the effects of compounding.

It's power is in its versatility - mostly used as a [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) concept, but can be applied to [knowledge](https://medium.com/@HowieDiamond/compound-knowledge-288292b4503d), relationships, and [time](https://tim.blog/2008/05/07/lifestyle-investing-compound-time-like-compound-interest/).

Some of the core ideas of compounding.
- Given it's verstaility, there are multiple currencies of compounding. You can measure it in units of money, trust, knowledge, or capability, almost anything. There also is an underlying concept of it being _stored_ somewhere. Obviously money sits in banks, knowledge is in our minds, trust in our hearts, and capability in our mind or bodies.  
- You have to have a non-zero starting point (principal). You cannot compound on nothing. That's obvious with money, but not so obvious with other things. For knowledge, that includes the basics of whatever field you're studying. In relationships, a base of trust must be first established to build upon over time.
- Compounding frequency is how often the benefit of compounding is realized. Greater frequency often results in greater benefit in the long term. For non-monetary compounding, a good way is to build [habits]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-04-productivity-tuesday-habits %}) to allocate time to whatever you _want_ to compound.
- Regular contributions can significantly amplify the effects of compounding. 
- The passage of time is necessary to realize its effects. The benefits will often play out in the long term.

I like this quote from [Naval Ravikant](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103908947263488)
> Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

The internet is a marketplace for attention and a grounds for applying the principle of compounding. We can compound our impact on the internet by creating media and building products that will have long term value.
