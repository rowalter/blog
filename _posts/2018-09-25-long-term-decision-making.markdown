In the last few Productivity Tuesday's I've been covered practices that apply to managing hours, days and weeks. 

Today I want to cover some of the frameworks that I have collected to help make decisions on longer time scales - in the order of years and decades.

Many of these long term decisions require time and deep reflection. They cannot and should not be applied in a rush. 



- How long term decisions create focus
- Use them all, and see where there is overlap
- Habits of retrospective and planning apply, but in longer cycles
