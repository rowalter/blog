Some highlights from 2018. This was a transformative year, and these are some rough notes and highlights.

What went well:
* Becoming a parent to twin girls in June
* Taking a 6 month parental leave and spending more time with family
* Sponsoring my parents who immigrated to Canada
* Spending a lot of time thinking about my identity, family and future
* Getting rid of my financial advisor and taking control of our personal investment strategy
* Starting a daily writing habit

What didn't go well:
* Parenting killed good sleep and gym habits - not surprising, but the recovery is taking longer than I expected
* A few extended bouts of anxiety and depression in the middle of the year

At the beginning of the year, I chose not to create any specific resolutions except to develop better daily habits - no working from home, read more regularly, take care of your body. I feel good about where I ended up.
