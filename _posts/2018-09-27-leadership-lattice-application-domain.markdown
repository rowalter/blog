Leadership Wednesday was delayed by a day because I wanted to write about productivity yesterday.

The next layer of the Leadership Lattice is the application domain, which is about managing the output and outcomes of the organization. It's about _what the team does_. 

A leader is ultimately accountable for the output and outcome of the team. However, it's easy to disproportionately spend time in this domain (especially becoming prescriptive about outputs). This is a common misstep I've noticed in new leaders, and one I've made many times myself. The most sustainable leadership approaches are ultimately exercised through people and teams. 

This is a very expansive domain of concern, and can easily be divided into two sub-domains: outputs and outcomes. Outputs are what teams do, and outcomes are the results of those outputs. Outputs are often divided into functions - sales, engineering, product management, support. Outcomes are measured within the environment those outputs operate - in markets, with customers - both external and internal. 

It may seem as if one guiding mental model is not enough - but I think the concept of the _knowledge loop_ covers it quite well. The knowledge loop is the cycle of decision making > execution > learning that takes place in organizations. Decisions guide execution, which creates learning, which in turn drives decisions. This cycle occurs at an individual level, team level, and organization level. As such, there is an argument for making the individual and team concerns a part of their respective layers in the lattice. What you do, how you do it, and what results from this across different timescales is a good way to encapsulate the application domain.

The practices of this domain include:
* Decision Making Frameworks
* Strategy and Strategic Planning
* Functional Excellence (sales, product, engineering, etc)
* Analytics and Research
* Knowledge management

I'll be collecting more frameworks to share in this domain. However, given the domain is so expansive and domain specific, it deserves another post.
