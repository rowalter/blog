Moving to post capital world. Capital isn't scarce, attention span is. 

Capital represented by  
Money. Where we spend becomes valuable. Where Attention represented by the data. 


How we spend our money > capital markets

How we spend our attention > 

What happens when we collectively realize the value of our data? Do we stop giving it to those that abuse it? 

Attention is the scarce resource.
