This is a continuation of the previous post on [Learning Loops]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-01-learning-loops %}). Decision making frameworks guide execution and are the "problem solving" step in the learning loop. This post is essentially a collection of frameworks that can help with decision making in a variety of contexts. 

Just like other frameworks - think of these as tools in your toolbelt when faced with any decision. If given the luxury of time, apply multiple frameworks to make the decision.

- **Inversion** is thinking about a problem backwards - it is about achieving positive outcomes by simply avoiding any negative outcomes. This was popularized by Charlie Munger, who also used a great example to illustrate it: "If you want to help India, the question you should ask is not “how can I help India,” it’s “what is doing the worst damage in India? What will automatically do the worst damage and how do I avoid it?”. More on Inversion [here](https://fs.blog/2013/10/inversion/) and [here](https://25iq.com/2015/09/12/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-charlie-munger-about-inversion-including-the-importance-of-being-consistently-not-stupid-2/).

- **Divergent and Convergent Thinking** is the exercise of creating multiple options (divergence), and then narrowing down on those options (convergence). When faced with decisions, it's always useful to articulate _all_ the possible outcomes before making a choice about any specific one. From the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_thinking) page for convergent thinking is this important insight - "it is most effective in situations where an answer readily exists and simply needs to be either recalled or worked out through decision making strategies". 

- **Second Order Thinking**

- **Decision Reversibility & Consequence** is an evaluation of a decision based on how easy it is to undo. 

- **Checklist Manifesto**
