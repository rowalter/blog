Tuesday at Night Summit is when the deals get done. Start your night at The Beer Hall with DJ Lulu Wei, where the first 200 guests will receive drinks on CPA Ontario. Then stop by Mill Street Brew Pub, Archeo, or grab a bite at one of the Distillery District’s many food trucks. In the early 2000s, the Distillery District evolved beyond its Victorian charm and re-opened as Canada’s premier culture and arts hub. Everything about this neighbourhood radiates modernity and outside-the-box thinking. It’s the ideal spot for the best of your Collision networking. See you at The Beer Hall (21 Tank House Lane), Mill Street Brew Pub (21 A Tank House Lane), and Archeo (31 Trinity St). Tips for the night: Night Summit events are for Collision attendees only. Remember your wristband and lanyard for access into venues, and don't forget your government-issued photo ID. For discounted drinks at each venue, ask for the ‘Collision special’.
