I'm starting a small side project. 

I've always been interested in our relationship with software products. I want to explore a specific part of this relationship further - how software can be used to promote _understanding_. I will start in a domain I'm familiar with - a workplace of knowledge workers, but it might expand.

Today, knowledge workers realize more than ever the necessity and power of strong relationships - especially within a working environment. They create high performing teams. They drive results. They make it fun to come to work.

But I've found what's available to help is a frustrating and therefore under utilized experience. I'll be building and sharing a few tools to help me through some of the pain points I've experienced first hand. 

Stay tuned!
