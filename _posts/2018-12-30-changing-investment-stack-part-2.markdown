In the [first part]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-28-changing-investment-stack %}) of this series, I detailed my move from a financial advisor to an independent brokerage, focusing on the account setup and asset transfer. In this part, I detail the steps I followed to change my investment strategy.

DISCLAIMER: I do not provide personal investment advice and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor. I will not and cannot be held liable for any actions you take as a result of anything you read here.

**Step 1: Understanding My Current Strategy and Allocation**

Having an advisor is a useful abstraction away from the details of your investments. You often don't know _where_ your money is - you just trust it's in the right place. In my case, before I was considering changing anything, I had to really understand what my _existing_ risk profile and strategy was - and how this was reflected in my asset allocation. I found a few issues. 

First, the the underlying investments were mostly based on speculation on the growth potential of certain industries and countries. It wasn't that I didn't believe those industries were growing - the reasoning wasn't very clear. I didn't understand it, so I wasn't sure why my money was invested in it. 

Second, my portfolio was "over diversified" into almost every asset class - stocks, treasury bonds, index funds, ETFs, mutual funds - and it no longer reflected my risk profile. 

Third, many of the asset classes had unreasonably high fees that ate into returns.

**Step 2: Deciding on A New Allocation**

This is an ongoing process, and the objective was to create an allocation reflective of my financial goals and risk profile. This involved a fair amount of learning through reading and conversations.

I won't go into the details of my new allocation, but it is a combination of [mostly] equities and some cash to give me flexibility to buy more.

**Step 3: Setup Your New Target Asset Allocation**

This was a two step process - selling the old and buying the new. I decided not to market time and made all my sell orders almost as soon as the transfer between brokerages was complete. 

The buy process is taking a little bit longer, primarily because of the recent activity in the market. I had a conversation recently ([and wrote about]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-08-entering-bear-markets %})) entering bear markets as an amateur investor.

This was a long and drawn out process - especially because it was my first time and I was extra cautious. I learned a lot along the way and am looking forward to taking greater control of my investments.
