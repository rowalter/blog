Amazon announced it's echo buds recently, creating a low priced Airpods competitor tied to the Alexa ecosystem. The relatively low pricepoint ($130) can skyrocket adoption.

A few months ago I wrote about how we are [getting closer to software]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-29-closer-software %}). While Echobuds aren't novel, it's just another development in bringing software closer to our physical selves. 

I also happened to talk to a student from [The Knowledge Society](https://theksociety.com/), an incubator for some brilliant high school students - who was investigating the world of 3D printed organs, gene editing and CRISPR.

Technologists love to extrapolate. Potential does not equal adoption, but it really is amazing to think about how some of the technology being created today will look like twenty or thirty years from now.
