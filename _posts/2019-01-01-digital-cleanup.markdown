I decided to start the year with a digital cleanup project - it's an exercise to get rid of all the digital junk that I've collected over the years. 

- Unsubscribing to old email subscriptions
- Unsubscribing to paid subscription services and 
- Removing old Simplenote notes and tags
- Cleaning up and categorizing Google Docs
- Removing myself from Slack channels

Locally on my computer:
- Deleting the "Downloads" folder where all sorts of random things end up

On my phone:
- Apps that I no longer use
-
