There's been [some](https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1053295266088927232) [discussion](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1053064166825586689) in Tech Twitter about remote work recently. Remote work is not without it's flaws, but just like anything in the workplace - it only works when managed well.

This post is a commentary on how remote work creates a forcing function for knowledge management habits that enforces team learning. 

Whether they are intentional about it or not, all individuals and teams are executing some form of [learning loop]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-01-learning-loops %}). Teams _learn together_ by sharing their experience, insights, knowledge and skills with each other about how to do things better. In order for teams to learn together, they execute a learning loop in a regular cadence (cadences can be weeks, months, or even years).

While colocated, a team's learning habits can be easily neglected. These include practices like capturing knowledge, documenting key decisions, and creating good onboarding practices. After all - when sharing experience and insights is a simple conversation away, any form of documentation feels like a burden. These practices seem like dwelling on the past when we are so focused thinking about the future.

When individuals are remote and especially across multiple time zones, this creates a forcing function that, among other things, enforces better knowledge practices within a team. Knowledge capture becomes an essential to a team's function - documenting key decisions and capturing meeting notes becomes a necessity vs. a chore. 

Also, when they are continually referenced in future decisions, the value of those insights becomes clear, and you can start to realize the benefits of compounded insights over time. For new members on a team or project, this provides invaluable context that can speed up a person's onboarding experience.

In an era where companies are actively conditioning themselves to handle change and learn quickly, we can borrow a page from the remote handbook to enforce better knowledge management habits.
