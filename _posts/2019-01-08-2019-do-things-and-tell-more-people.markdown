2018 was a busy year.

The highlight was, ofcourse, becoming a parent to twin girls. I spent most of the year on an extended parental leave, and I'm really happy about that decision.

Parenting is a full-court-press experience. It's most difficult thing I've ever done, by far.

The things I expected all happened, _in spades_ - the exhaustion, lack of sleep, poor eating habits. What I didn't expect is how it made me question my own identity. 

It wasn't what you might expect. The emotions of fatherhood don't really kick in until later. It happened through intensive and ruthless prioritization. 

When you go from almost 7-8 hours of free time in a day (not counting full time work and sleep) to just 30-60 minutes - you're forced to prioritize what's really important.

For me, I realized it was really important to have some kind of productive, creative output - ideally everyday, but definitely on a regular basis during the week. The challenge was fitting that into a parenting schedule. Something I could do whether I had 20 minutes or 2 hours

So I opened my laptop and started writing.

Since blogging in August 2018, I've written over 135 articles about everything from leadership, productivity, technology, mental models, finance, and whatever else comes to mind. I've used it as a tool for learning, a way to think things through, a journal and sometimes just a bookmarking tool.

But I kept quiet about the whole thing. I love writing but I've never _considered myself a writer_. Once in a while I'd share articles directly to friends that I thought might be interested.

I've fallen into this trap before, and want to change.

In 2019, I want to simply [do things and tell _more_ people]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-07-do-things-and-tell-people %}). So I'm starting here - by telling you what I've been up to for the last few months.

I'm excited about the new year, and I hope you are too.
