2018 was a busy year.

The highlight was, ofcourse, becoming a parent to twin girls. I spent most of the year on an extended parental leave, and I'm really happy about that decision.

Parenting is a [full-court-press](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/full-court%20press) experience. It's most difficult thing I've ever done, by far.

There are things I expected - the exhaustion, lack of sleep, poor eating habits - all of those happened in spades. What I didn't expect is how it made me question my identity, which came in the form of prioritizing my time.

When you go from almost 7-8 hours of free time in a day (not counting full time work and sleep) to just 30-60 minutes - you're forced to prioritize what's really important. 

For me, I realized it was really important to have some kind of productive, creative output every day. And I needed to fit that into a parenting schedule. Something I could do whether I had 5 minutes or 2 hours. 

So, I started writing, and created this simple [blog](www.tarunsachdeva.com).

Since starting in August 2018, I've written over 135 articles about everything from leadership, productivity, technology, mental models, finance, and whatever else comes to mind. I've used it as a tool for learning, a way to think things through, a journal and sometimes just a bookmarking tool.

But I kept quiet about the whole thing. I love writing but I've never considered myself a writer, so I only sent articles directly to friends that I thought might be interested. 

In 2019, I want to simply [do things and tell _more_ people]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-07-do-things-and-tell-people %}). So I'm starting here - by telling you what I've been up to for the last few months.

I'm excited about the new year, and I hope you are too.
