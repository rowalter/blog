2018 was a busy year.

The highlight was, ofcourse, becoming a parent to [twin girls](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkg8IrjnVjb/). I spent most of the year on an extended parental leave, and I'm really happy about that decision.

Parenting is a full-court-press experience. It's most difficult thing I've ever done, by far. The things I expected - the emotion, exhaustion, and bad eating habits - all happened, _in spades_.

But I didn't expect to question my own identity. I went from hours of free time a day, to sometimes only 30 minutes. I was forced to ruthlessly prioritize what's really mattered.

For me, I realized it was really important to have some kind of productive, creative output everyday. I needed something to work on, that fit into the new parent schedule. Something I could do whether I had 20 minutes or 2 hours.

So, in August of last year, I opened my laptop and started writing.

Fast forward to today, I've published over 135 articles so far. I've written about everything from leadership, productivity, technology, mental models, finance, and whatever else comes to mind. I've used it as a tool for learning, a way to think things through, a journal and sometimes just a bookmarking tool.

But I kept quiet about the whole thing. I enjoy writing but never considered myself a _writer_. The only people that knew were the friends I'd share with occasionally.

This is a familiar problem, and and it's time to change.

In 2019, my goal is simple. To [do things and tell _more_ people]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-07-do-things-and-tell-people %}). So I'm starting here - by telling you what I've been up to for the last few months.

I'm excited about the new year, and hope you are too.
