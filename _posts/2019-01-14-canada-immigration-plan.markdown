Every year, the Ministry of Immigration releases an [annual report](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/annual-report-parliament-immigration-2018/report.html) to Parliament on immigration. It's a comprehensive report to understand what the ministry is planning for the next few years.

Some higlights from the Minister's letter this year:

> With this in mind, Canada welcomed more than 286,000 permanent residents in 2017. Over half were admitted under Economic Class programs. The number also included over 44,000 resettled refugees, protected persons and people admitted under humanitarian, compassionate and public policy considerations.
> 
> Also in 2017, the Government of Canada adopted a historic multi-year levels plan to responsibly grow our annual immigration levels to 340,000 by 2020, with 60 percent of the growth in the Economic Class. Growing immigration levels, particularly in the Economic Class, will help us sustain our labour force, support economic growth and spur innovation.

This table breaks it down:

It's great to see that the government understands the role of immigrants and is looking to grow our programs. I'd also like to see is more done for the _new_ immigrant experience itself - focusing on the language barriers, employment issues and trouble finding housing. The physical and cultural shock of a life-move are difficult enough.
