This is the first in a series of posts to detail a thesis of how decentralization is taking place. I'm focusing on online marketplaces and service aggregators across diffirent industries. First, a definition:

> **Decentralization:** The process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are _distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group_.

For marketplaces, decentralization is the process of losing trust in that central intermediary. This can happen on both the supply and demand side. In this post, I'll focus on the former.

Here's how most marketplaces start:

SUPPLIERS >>> MARKETPLACE >>> CUSTOMERS

HOSTS >>> AIRBNB >>> TRAVELLERS
DRIVERS >>> UBER >>> RIDERS
GROCERIES >>> INSTACART >>> SHOPPERS

* Hosts benefit on Airbnb from a new income stream (potentially a new career altogether), and travellers have a convenient way to have an authentic experience.
* Drivers benefit on Uber from a new income stream (potentially a new career altogether), and riders have a more convenient way to get from A to B.
* You can be a grocery deliverer on Instacart and make a new income stream (potentially a new career altogether), and customers have a new way to get groceries (in a way that wasn't possible before)  

Suppliers - the creatives, merchants  and makers - have benefitted through access to a built-in customer base that can help them build audiences and drive up sales. To customers, a marketplace is a convenient one stop shop, offering broad selection and fulfillment for everything from fine art to furniture. 


Suppliers lose trust when intermediaries start to squeeze their margins, treat them unfairly and in general are not helping them grow their business. This happens in the name of a customer 

Customer trust in intermediaries erodes when there's reduced utility (e.g poor selection, data abuse, ). This is happening in the financial, medical industry, and social media.

Version 1 of marketplaces is about connecting suppliers to potential customers, and providing customers with a simple discovery and fulfillment/consumption experience. Version 2 is about opening up entirely new opportunities altogether, and enabling them to operate as an independent.









1. Decentralization is the process of losing trust in a central intermediary. In online marketplaces, this can happen on both the supply and demand side. 

2. Suppliers can lose trust when intermediaries start to squeeze their margins, treat them unfairly and in general are not helping them grow their business.

is taking place as intermediaries are losing trust across many industries.

Suppliers of goods and services are losing trust that these intermediaries have their best interests in mind. Where they were once a channel for healthy income (and in many cases their only income), their margins are being squeezed and they are getting consistently mistreated - all in the name of increasing 'marketplace value'. We can expect suppliers across industries flocking to companies enabling them to operate more independently. Shopify is the obvious and leading example for this in commerce, but this is happening [in other industries](https://dumpling.us/). Mistreating makers has effects on the other side of the marketplace. 

As suppliers become independent and start owning the customer relationship themselves, customers will likely benefit through lower costs and higher quality of goods and services. However, they will need the tools to manage their experience given they are interacting directly with suppliers and not an intermediary.

This is happening in finance, media. These will look like utility businesses but what they are actually doing is aggregating demand. They will have to offer the services that centralized providers don't want to provide like data portability - that to a centralized player are a threat to their business, but for a new age consumer company actually increase their value. This is why I believe there isn't as strong of a case for data network effects unless you are operating at mega scale.

On the supply side, makers will lose trust in marketplace that don't consider their needs first. 

After all, a marketplace is a single channel for a maker to become successful.

Suppliers lose trust in marketplaces when they find they are . and will look to further build their relationships directly with consumers. This is well underway in retail, media, and many other industries.

The consumer side si 



Regardless we're going to see a crop of businesses that help people operate as independents - as trust erodes across the board. on the customer side, they need the tools to manage their experience given they are interacting directly with suppliers and not an intermediary. 

Individuals > using creative utilities > Create businesses

Money will flow to individuals, companies creating creative utilities, and companies enabling them to create businesses.

Investing in people and no code movements. As independent entreprenurs.

There's another angle here that's interesting - emerging markets will entirely skip over the phase of consolidated offerings and start in an environment of being more decentralized than not. india is a really important one to watch here.
