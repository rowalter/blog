I was having a conversation recently about leadership frameworks, and found myself stumbling around the description of the Leadership Lattice. I'm using this post to clarify some of these thoughts.

The Lattice is a learning framework that can help you contextualize leadership advice. 

- Leadership is an  exercise in attention management. This can be true for any knowledge task - but it's effects are amplified as a manager. Where someone focuses their effort can be a leading indicator of progress in that area.

- you're accountable for  everything but you can only focus on one thing at a time. the lattice is a framework for managing attention as a leader

- 
- Leaders have to change as the company grows. 
- Leaders have to think of everything.





* **Management frameworks help us focus**. As a knowledge worker, and especially as a leader, it's critical to manage your attention intentionally. 






Frameworks act as a natural filter (atleast they do for me). Frameworks provide me the structure to plan my days and weeks. If I find yourself working on something _outside_ of what a framework defines, it's a good signal I might be focused on the wrong thing.






This is a framework that connects how individual contribution leads to the desired impact. 

Everything that comes in the middle is the responsibility of a company's leaders.
