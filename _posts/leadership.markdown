I'm Some notes on leadership.

* **Management frameworks help us focus**. As a knowledge worker, and especially as a leader, it's critical to manage your attention intentionally. 






Frameworks act as a natural filter (atleast they do for me). Frameworks provide me the structure to plan my days and weeks. If I find yourself working on something _outside_ of what a framework defines, it's a good signal I might be focused on the wrong thing.






This is a framework that connects how individual contribution leads to the desired impact. 

Everything that comes in the middle is the responsibility of a company's leaders.
