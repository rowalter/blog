My productivity stack is the set of frameworks and tools used to get things done. There are three categories - planning, execution, and reflection.



Planning is the process of looking ahead.
* Lists structure
* Habits aren't planned, they're just done

Execution
* Prioritizing the day
* Pomodoros

Reflection
* Daily, Weekly, Monthly
