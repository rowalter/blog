It's the new year, which means _productivity_ is a hot topic. My productivity stack is a framework for getting things done. I've developed it over the last year, but it's always being tuned.

The framework follows a simple structure:
* Planning - How I plan to get the right things done
* Execution - How I execute on things
* Reflection - How 

Planning is the process of looking ahead.
* Lists structure
* Habits aren't planned, they're just done

Execution
* Prioritizing the day
* Pomodoros

Reflection
* Daily, Weekly, Monthly
