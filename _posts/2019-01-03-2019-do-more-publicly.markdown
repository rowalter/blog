2018 was a busy year.

The highlight was, ofcourse, becoming a parent to twins. I decided to spend most of my time this year with my new family on an extended parental leave. I'm really happy about that decision.

Parenting is all-consuming, but turning off from work was still difficult. It was (and still is) such a strong part of my identity.

I needed a creative, productive outlet that fit with the parenting schedule. Something I could do whether I had 5 minutes or 2 hours. I started writing, and created a simple [blog](www.tarunsachdeva.com).

I've written about leadership, technology, mental models, finance, and whatever else comes to mind. 

Some of the best of this exercise so far:

- Leadership Lattice
- Technology Articles
- Productivity

Sometimes I've been tired and frustrated and the words don't really come out. Sometimes "writing" is just a link to something interesting I saw on hacker news.

I never really considered myself a writer, so I never went public with it. In 2019, I want to do more publicly. So I'm starting here - by telling you what I've been up to for the last few months.

I'm excited about the new year, and I hope you are too. Let's get this paper.
