This blog is completely [open source](https://github.com/tarunsachdeva/blog/). It is based on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) library, which helps people create static sites, and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Why?

- Github letâ€™s me track changes in an [extremely detailed](https://github.com/tarunsachdeva/blog/commits/gh-pages) way. All my edits are available for anyone to see, which creates a strange sense of vulnerability and accountability. 
- Hosting it myself allows a lot of control, with minimal overhead because it is a static site (there is no database). Jekyll has great integration with Github and an active community to help with any issues.

Everything here is boilerplate Jekyll except the theme and the fact it lives in a subdirectory (thanks to [this article](http://shahrajat.com/2016-06-22-install-jekyll-subdirectory-blog-github-pages/)).
