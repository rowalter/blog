Software isn't eating the world, its modelling it. 

It's modelling our relationships. 

It's modelling how we make money. 

It's modelling how we trust. 

It's modelling our personalities. 

But software is imperfect. Models over simplify. They leave out rough edges. 

And to what end? What happens when we've built the perfect model of our world? How do we use that to become better people?

Software becomes a feedback loop - the model creates ideal behaviour for us to follow. 

There's a lot to be modelled. What exists in the real world remains to.
