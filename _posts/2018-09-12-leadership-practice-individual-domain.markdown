Leadership roles have a massive surface area of accountability, and the process of learning as you go can be challenging. As part of **Leadership Wednesdays**, I'll be detailing the framework that I use to make the learning easier to manage (and quicker). To get a better understanding of this framework, check out [these]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-29-developing-leadership-practice %}) [posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-05-leadership-wednesdays %}).

The first domain of responsibility is that of **Individuals**. 

* The responsibility scope is about managing the journey of being an employee - bringing an individual onboard, setting them up to succeed, providing direction and guidance, and managing their departure from an organization.

* The individual domain is one of the most expansive domains, and it covers the following practices throughout the employee journey:
	* Sourcing and Interviewing
	* Hiring and Onboarding
	* Creating paths for growth, development and training
	* Understanding strengths and weaknesses, and unlocking individual potential
	* Creating clarity in individual objectives and goals
	* Managing individual output and performance
	* Providing guidance and feedback
	* Placement within the organization: promotions and demotions
	* Managing their exit, if necessary (firing, quitting, etc)

* There are hundreds, if not thousands of frameworks to help with the above practices. These come from books, blog posts, and other places. These are the tangibles that help make the practices of leadership easier. An incomplete list is below:
	* Growth and Development: Training plans, Skills matrix
	* Understanding Them: User Manuals
	* Goals and Output: OKR's
	* Guidance and Feedback: 1:1s, Direct Feedback methods

* Other Resources: 
	* Daniel Pink: Autonomy Mastery Growth
	* Andy Grove: High Output Management
