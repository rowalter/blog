Leadership roles have a massive surface area of accountability, and the process of learning as you go can be challenging. As part of **Leadership Wednesdays**, I'll be detailing the framework that I use to make the learning easier to manage (and quicker). To get a better understanding of this framework, check out [these]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-29-developing-leadership-practice %}) [posts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-05-leadership-wednesdays %}).

The first domain of responsibility is that of **Individuals**. 

* The responsibility scope is large, but using the framework of "the employee journey" is a good encapsulation. Managing the employee journey can help you articulate where there are missing links in management capabilities - whether that is bringing an individual onboard, setting them up to succeed, providing direction and guidance, or managing their departure from an organization.

* Going through the employee journey, the following is list of some of those practices:

	* Sourcing and Interviewing
	* Hiring and Onboarding
	* Creating paths for growth, development and training
	* Understanding strengths and weaknesses, and unlocking individual potential
	* Creating clarity in individual objectives and goals
	* Managing individual output and performance
	* Providing guidance and feedback
	* Placement within the organization: promotions and demotions
	* Managing their exit, if necessary (firing, quitting, etc)

* There are hundreds, if not thousands of frameworks to help with the above practices. These come from books, blog posts, and other places. These are the tangibles that help make the practices of leadership easier. Remember these are tools in your toolbelt. There are multiple ways of managing each one of the above areas of responsibility. 

	* Growth and Development: Training plans, Skills matrix
	* Understanding Them: User Manuals
	* Goals and Output: OKR's
	* Guidance and Feedback: 1:1s, Direct Feedback methods
