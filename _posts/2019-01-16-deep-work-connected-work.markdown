Deep Work is a term coined by Cal Newport in his [book](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) of the same name.

> Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. 

Communication tasks - email, chat - are often considered the enemy of deep work. 

> And yet, **most people have lost the ability to go deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media**, not even realizing there’s a better way.

**Connected work** is a new mode of working, enabled through apps like Slack and Microsoft Teams. Connected work is when work happens as part of the communication itself - where everyone is sharing data and context, and working together. 

**Connected work is high bandwidth communication _and_ simultaneous productive output.**

Many light workflows are best suited in connected work environments - moving tickets forward in a queue, approvals and signoffs, and responding to customer support tickets. All of these are enabled by chat interleaved with data and workflows from other apps.

Connected work accelerates the pace of decisions and information sharing in a team, and also fosters an environment of transparency. I expect we will operate more in connected work environments in the future.
