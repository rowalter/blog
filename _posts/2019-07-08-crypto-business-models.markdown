Fred Wilson recently [wrote](https://avc.com/2019/07/business-model-innovation/) about how Crypto's promise is not just in the technical but the business model innovation that comes alongside it. 

There's an analogy that comes to mind - gaming and virtual currencies. In-app purchases and subscriptions are often mapped to coins, passes, candy and other currencies that can be redeemed in an app. Once they have been translated into these virtual currencies, we can similarly innovate on different business models that might work best in a specific scenario. For example, we can setup a subscription to get coins every month, and then use those coins to purchase content or pay other users in an app.

Think of the world modelled as a game, cryptocurrencies are the virtual goods that exist within those games. They have value, can be bought and sold, and can be traded in for other currencies (including fiat). The more mature games have multiple currencies running in parallel, much in the same way there are hundreds of possible cryptocurrencies to purchase. Unfortunately right now not many are being used, but perhaps Libra can change all that.
