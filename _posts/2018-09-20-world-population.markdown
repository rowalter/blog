A short post today. I saw this visual yesterday - a cartogram of the world population from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram).

It's a powerful visual and really puts a lot into perspective. 

From the post:

> To show global data it is convenient to use a map. But despite the popularity and familiarity of world maps, they can mislead our understanding of how living conditions around the world are changing. They are made for a different purpose; geographical maps show us where the world’s land masses are and where country borders run. They don’t show us where the people are.
