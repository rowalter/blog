The world was on #KawhiWatch today. I was getting multiple messages full of rumours and hearsay. 

It's pretty insane to see this happening. No athlete in recent memory has gotten this type of attention. It's incredible to be a witness. 

The choice is pretty clear. Toronto objectively is a better city for Kawhi.

That said, we need to chill a bit. ðŸ˜‚
