I've been interested in how calendar apps will evolve. I've written about [some hypotheses]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-01-23-calendar-network-platform %}) before. 

Calendars are an invisible thread that exist in every booking use case - for everything from events, to restaurants and barbers. However the booking process often starts and ends within the providers sites themselves. Sometimes they offer the ability to add something to your calendar, but that's about it. 

I wonder if we could turn this around - if we could book from the calendar itself, without  having to switch contexts. Essentially take a customer centric approach to the calendar vs one optimized for service providers availability. It would be super convenient for me to add a time slot in my calendar for an appointment which then check availability for a service provider right there (or find one that is already available).

I can imagine taking this to the next step and enabling to do lists  with calendar availability too. Adding a task like "Get a haircut" to your list  then shows the availability of your preferred hairdresser or barber, and you can do the booking process right there (yes I need a haircut and this is on my list). 

This feels like a problem Google will eventually get to, but I think there's a ton of room for improvement in how we manage our time.
