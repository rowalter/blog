There is no shortage of management and leadership advice. Consuming and processing it in an attempt to improve one's abilities is daunting. This post is about a framework for **learning** within the domains of management and leadership. The goal is to provide a structured latticework that can help pick up new skills like tools in a tool box. This approach to learning is similar to that of mental models. 

The notion of creating a latticework as a means to learn was popularized by [Charlie Munger](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html):
>Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.

Given the expansive set of advice and knowledge freely available on the topic of management and leadership, a framework for learning was necessary was necessary for me.

The framework itself is quite simple - it is a list of all of the domains of leadership, and how they interact with each other as a system. My experience is in that of software startups, some parts of this are applicable outside of that context as well.

To built the latticework, I started with a description of what is happening inside startups and corporations today:

**Individuals working together, making decisions and executing towards positive outcomes and meaningful impact.** 

This is a very generic description, so I broke this down further to highlight **the domains of responsibility of a leader**. The domains outline the **scope of the role**, which is the starting point to building a learning framework.

* Individual Domain, concerned with management at an individual level 
* Organization Domain, concerned with how people organize and effectively work together
* Output Domain, concerned with what is actually being created (can be divided into functional groups like code, design, sales, or broader outputs, like the decisions). 
* Ecosystem Domain, concerned with the customers, markets and environment in which you're operating. Major strategic decisions will fall into this domain. 
* Impact Domain, concerned with the broader impacts of what's being created

This is a system in which these domains are highly connected to each other, and they interact with the adjacent ones. Individual impact teams, teams impact outputs, etc. 

In further posts, I'll expand on each domain. I will also stress test this framework through my personal experience and practice, as well as through examining how battle-tested leadership practices can be added into this approach. I’m looking forward to seeing when and how this breaks.
