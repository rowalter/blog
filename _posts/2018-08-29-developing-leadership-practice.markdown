There is no shortage of leadership advice in books and articles across the internet (this isn't one of them). This post is about a framework for **learning**. The goal is to provide a structured latticework that can help pick up new skills in the domain of leadership, like tools in a tool box. This approach to learning is similar to that of mental models. 

The framework itself is quite simple - it is a list of all of the domains of leadership, and how they interact with each other as a system. My experience is in that of software startups, but I imagine this can extend outside of that as well. In developing the domains, I took a first principles approach. This started with a simple description of what is actually happening in many organizations, for which a leader is accountable: 

**Individuals working together, producing output towards positive outcomes and meaningful impact.**

Breaking this down further, the domains of responsibility of a leader are:

* Individual Domain, concerned with management at an individual level 
* Organization Domain, concerned with how people organize and effectively work together
* Output Domain, concerned with what is actually being created (can be divided into functional groups like code, design, sales, or broader outputs, like the decisions). 
* Ecosystem Domain, concerned with the customers, markets and environment in which you're operating. Major strategic decisions will fall into this domain. 
* Impact Domain, concerned with the broader impacts of what's being created

This is a system in which these domains are highly connected to each other, and they interact with the adjacent ones. Individual impact teams, teams impact outputs, etc. 

In further posts, I'll expand on each domain. I will also stress test this framework through my personal experience and practice, as well as through examining how battle-tested leadership practices can be added into this approach. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing when and how this breaks.
