2018 was a busy year.

The highlight was ofcourse becoming a parent to [twin girls](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkg8IrjnVjb/). I spent most of the year on an extended parental leave, and I'm really happy about that decision.

Parenting is a full-court-press experience. Some parts of it were expected - the lost sleep, the emotional highs and lows, the bad eating habits. I knew it would be difficult, but I didn't expect to question my identity in the process. 

I went from hours of free time a day, to sometimes only 30 minutes. This made me ruthlessly prioritize what's really mattered.

I realized it was really important to have some kind of productive, creative output everyday. I needed something to work on, that fit into the new parent schedule. Something  that was still possible in 20 minutes or two hours. 

So I opened my laptop and started writing. I published this blog in August 2018. 

Fast forward to today, I've published over 135 articles. I've written about everything from leadership, productivity, technology, mental models, finance, and whatever else comes to mind. It has become a tool for learning, a way to think through ideas, a journal and sometimes just a bookmarking tool.

But I've been quiet about the whole thing. The only people that knew were the friends I'd share with occasionally.

This is a familiar pattern for me, and it's time to change.

In 2019, my goal is simple. To [do things and tell _more_ people]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-12-07-do-things-and-tell-people %}). So I'm starting here - by telling you what I've been up to for the last few months.

I'm excited about the new year, and hope you are too.
