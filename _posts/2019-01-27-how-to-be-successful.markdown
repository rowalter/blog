Sam Altman from YCombinator published [some perspectives](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) on how to be successful. 

I'm conflicted by this piece. 

On one hand it's incredibly useful - a condensed insight into the patterns of people seeking to make a mark in the world. A great guide to company building. 

On another hand, it feels a bit out of touch. It's a strange time for a leader from Silicon Valley to aggrandize the alpha mentality - focused only on self improvement and trying to outwork each other. 

Success is relative. Maybe this post should be named "How to be successful...as a founder trying to build a disruptive venture scale company in the Valley".
