It's 8, the kids are finally in bed. It's snowing outside and quiet inside. These are the dream hours for writing, but the words aren't coming easy.

Writer's block is weird. It can become so tangible that sometimes I actually _feel_ it. A dull heaviness in my head. Like I said, _weird_. 

Walking, reading, [freewriting](https://www.wikihow.com/Freewrite) - all have helped to a degree. But I often default to one method that I've found to be effective.

I ask - **what would _future you_ find helpful?**

The question helps to choose a topic. Sometimes those are familiar, like tech or mental models. Other times it sparks research, and the post just becomes an executive summary. Sometimes those topics have been on my mind for a while, and putting them into writing lightens my _future_ cognitive load.

Many of the posts on this blog have come from asking that question. I refer back to those posts and send them to people to illustrate my thinking.

This post is a reminder of that tool. When I'm blocked again in the future, I hope it will help me again.
