Personality assessments are well intentioned. They are supposed to help us understand ourselves and each other. Many of them are also grounded in scientific / psychological theory. There are a few I've used that worked quite well - the Enneagram is one of my favorites.

But there is so much about the experience of taking these tests that gets in the way of their efficacy.

First, taking the test is a painful experience. As an individual, filling out surveys often over 50-100 questions takes a long time because of poorly designed user interfaces. As a team, administering tests is fraught with issues. 

Second, data is often locked in. 

Third, your test is hard to share with others. Especially in a specific context. 




The experience sucks.
Data is locked in. 
Hard to share and apply how you want. Should be frictionless.
