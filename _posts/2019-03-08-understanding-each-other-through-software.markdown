This is a rewrite of yesterday's post about understanding each other better through software. 

How can Software play a role in creating and promoting empathy? More importantly - how _should_ it play that role? 

This is a challenging and unbounded problem.  It's difficult to know where to start. 

This can happens at many levels. Software can help us express ourselves creatively. The internet allows us to connect and share with each other. But what exists to really help us truly understand each other?

There are products that exist to help us with personality assessments. 

This is an area I'm really interested in exploring further. As software moves to higher order problems I imagine more problems of this nature coming to the surface.
