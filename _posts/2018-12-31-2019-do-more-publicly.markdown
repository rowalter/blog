2018 was a busy year on many fronts.

Most importantly - I became a parent, and decided to take an extended paternity leave. 

I started writing everyday in August 2018. It was a small bit of productive, creative output throughout my parental leave.

I written about leadership, finance, productivity, tech - but I was hesitant to share.




Next year, my focus is to do more in public.
