I've been interested in how the "Web 3.0" vision is evolving, and one of the companies that is leading the path is Blockstack - a platform for developing dApps (decentralized apps). 

There are 3 principles that define what type of apps developers can build using Blockstack:
- Users own their _data_, and can create apps on Blockstack using the [Gaia](https://github.com/blockstack/gaia) decentralized storage system
- Users own their _identity_, and have full control over how that is used. Blockstack provides the infrastructure to provide users that control.  
- Users have free choice of clients. Your identity and data can be easily transferred between dApps by default. You can build a dApp but if you are using Blockstack's Identity platform and decentralized data, it can technically be used by another app.

Developing dApps requires a significant change in mental models for developers. I do wish their website was designed around helping developers around these principles, instead of being hidden in their [docs](https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/dapp_principles.html). As a developer, I often want to bring decentralization into my apps in the form of **data** or **identity**. Blockstack provides an infrastructure for both of these, but it can be a bit hard to dig through.

There is also a very interesting funding model called [App Mining](https://app.co/mining) that pays out developers based on their rank in their internal app store. While this isn't using a specific crypto token, it shares the spirit of financially supporting the developer of a dApp.
