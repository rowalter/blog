There are two broad trends that will take place that will force decentralization.

Suppliers will lose trust in intermediaries and will look to further build their relationships directly with consumers. This is happening in retail, media.

Consumers will lose trust in the selection capability offered by big boxes and towards niches that offer them more value. This is happening in finance, media. These will look like utility businesses but what they are actually doing is aggregating demand. They will have to offer the services that centralized providers don't want to provide like data portability - that to a centralized player are a threat to their business, but for a new age consumer company actually increase their value. This is why I believe there isn't as strong of a case for data network effects unless you are operating at mega scale. 

Regardless we're going to see a crop of businesses that help people operate as independents - as trust erodes across the board. on the customer side, they need the tools to manage their experience given they are interacting directly with suppliers and not an intermediary. 

Individuals > using creative utilities > Create businesses

Money will flow to individuals, companies creating creative utilities, and companies enabling them to create businesses.

Investing in people and no code movements. As independent entreprenurs.


There's another angle here that's interesting - emerging markets will entirely skip over the phase of consolidated offerings and start in an environment of being more decentralized than not. india is a really important one to watch here.
