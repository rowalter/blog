I just finished [Atomic Habits](www.atomichabits.com) by James Clear. 

This is the type of book you want to read so fast (so you can put it to use), but _need_ to read fully to understand. Thankfully, it's mostly signal and very little filler, and reads fairly quickly. 

That said, it would also be a great book to pick up, read one chapter, and then put down again for a while. Each chapter stands on it's own - not surprising because it started as a series of blog posts.

There are many takeaways from the book, and Clear has done readers a great service by creating a [cheatsheet](https://atomichabits.com/cheatsheet) of the habits framework. 

I also really enjoyed the summaries at the end of every chapter. More books, especially non-fiction, should do this. 

Some of the key points that I found useful:
* Start by defining your identity, and then the behaviours. When we try to change our habits (add new or remove existing), we often focus on the behaviours - going to the gym, reading every day, etc. It's easier to write everyday if you consider yourself a _writer_. 
* Behaviour change follows the path of least resistance. Set up your environment and understand yourself to prevent the cues for bad habits. This is [inversion]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-01-decision-making-frameworks %}) applied to habit forming.
* Sometimes, it just comes down to writing it down and saying it aloud. Implementation intention statements can be an effective way to take action on new habits.
