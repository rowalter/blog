I've been fortunate to work with and manage some great product managers in my career. Each one had their own style and strengths. They all added dimension to my understanding of good product management.

One thing that was common amongst all of them - they all deeply understood the _why_ and _how_ of their products. 

The _Why_ is what motivates customers to use a product. It drives people to take out their phones and open your app, or visit your website. The Why is about understanding people, the environments they are in, and the problems they encounter. _Why_ doesn't come easy - it often reveals itself in nuance and conversation.

The _How_ is what customers do in a product. It's the behaviours, the interactions, and how they feel going through your product. The How is about the measurable feedback - for an individual customer or your entire base. _How_ can be easy to start, but difficult to do well. It reveals itself with intention about what to measure.

As a Product Manager, both Why and How give you perspective about your product and it's market. They can stand on their own, and you can certainly be successful by focusing on any one of them. I've met many PM's who are successful at one or the other. It's no uncommon to have teams where one PM is focused on "Why" and another on "How". 

Why without How can lead to big vision without any accountability. How without Why leads to a graveyard of products no one will use. When put together, How and Why provide the insight required to build great products.
