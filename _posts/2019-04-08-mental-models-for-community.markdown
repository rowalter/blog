• community is about user identity (who I am), user discovery (who are others), user connection (e.g. add/follow), and user interaction (chat etc). not necessarily in that priority.
• identity is typically shown with a profile but you can be a social product with little emphasis on identity (e.g reddit’s user profile is very sparse)
• user discovery happens all around the product - search, likes, retweets, etc.
• connection is about connecting with people inside the network, and then also bringing people into the network. it’s the first step action.
• interaction is the second step - doing something with users you connected with - chatting etc.
