It's been almost 3 weeks of writing everyday. Some days have been more challenging than others, especially given the unpredictable schedule of managing 3 month old twin girls.

A few reflections:

* I find myself getting into writing flow faster at night, but end up publishing well past midnight.
* [Theme Days]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-09-01-theme-days %}) have helped eliminate the burden of choice to write about, but some days I end up picking a topic too expansive and spend too much time outlining and researching vs. writing. I also committed to a theme day almost every week, and after a few days, I found it was too much and stopped. The only theme days I'm doing now are Productivity Tuesdays, Leadership Wednesdays, and Future Fridays. 
* Writing is an incredible learning tool, and very quickly highlights gaps in understanding on any topic. Writing an article (vs. just notes) forces ideas to be sequential and follow a natural order. That order requires ideas to build on each other naturally.
* Ending the day with a post gives me a sense of productive creative output, which is immensely satisfying.
* At some point, I'll probably combine some posts together into longer form essays on some topics.
