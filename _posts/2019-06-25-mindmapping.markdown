Ava DuVernay's latest work is a 4 part series on Netflix about the Central Park 5. It goes into detail about their experience - on the night of the event, throughout unfair incarceration, and assimilation back into normal society.

I don't say this lightly - It fucked me up. It made my blood boil, it made me cry, and it gave me so much respect for those five. Check it out on Netflix.
