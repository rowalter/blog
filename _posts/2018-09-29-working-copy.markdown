Working Copy is a very powerful, fully featured Git Client for iOS.

I use Working Copy to edit this blog on my phone. Because this blog is also a git repository, I can edit content and code. I just commit and push any changes to my Github repository and see them live.

While I wouldn't recommend it because there's no way to test on a local environment first, there's something really powerful about being able to make code changes on the go. It's not the most user friendly solution, but one that works well for me.

Working copy can be downloaded on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8&uo=6&at=1000lHq&ct=workingcopyapp).
