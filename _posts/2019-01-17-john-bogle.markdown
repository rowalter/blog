John Bogle died yesterday. He was the founder of the Vanguard Group - the largest provider of mutual funds and second largest provider of exchange-traded funds in the world. Vanguard has over $5.1 _trillion_ in management.

I'm surprised his name isn't mentioned more in the news alongside Warren Buffet and Ray Dalio. He's probably had more impact on the individual investors than _anyone_ else.

He is famously known for creating the world's first index fund - funds tied to the performance of a stock market index like the S&P500. From Vanguard's [official statement](https://pressroom.vanguard.com/news/Press-Release-Vanguard-Announces-Passing-Of-Founder-Jack-Bogle-011619.html) of his death:

> In 1976, Vanguard introduced the first index mutual fund—First Index Investment Trust—for individual investors. Ridiculed by others in the industry as “un-American” and “a sure path to mediocrity,” the fund collected a mere $11 million during its initial underwriting. Now known as Vanguard 500 Index Fund, it has grown to be one of the industry’s largest, with more than $441 billion in assets (the sister fund, Vanguard Institutional Index Fund, has $221.5 billion in assets). Today, index funds account for more than 70% of Vanguard’s $4.9 trillion in assets under management; they are offered by many other fund companies as well and they make up most exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For his pioneering of the index concept for individual investors, Mr. Bogle was often called the “father of indexing.”

He was also a champion for greater transparency and lower costs in the mutual fund industry: 

> A champion of the individual investor, Mr. Bogle is widely credited with helping to bring increased disclosure about mutual fund costs and performance to the public. His commitment to safeguarding investors' interests often prompted him to speak out against practices that were common among his peers in other mutual fund organizations. “We are more than a mere industry,” he insisted in a 1987 speech before the National Investment Company Services Association. “We must hold ourselves to higher standards, standards of trust and fiduciary duty. Change we must—in our communications, our pricing structure, our product, and our promotional techniques.”

His impact will last multiple generations - not something that can be said for many people.
