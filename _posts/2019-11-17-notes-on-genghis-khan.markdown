I'm slow reading [What You Do is Who You Are](https://www.amazon.com/What-You-Do-Who-Are-ebook/dp/B07NVN4QCM) by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section. This post is about Genghis Khan's rise to power and what it has to teach us about establishing culture.
