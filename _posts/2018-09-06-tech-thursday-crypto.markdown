Through **Tech Thursday**, the perspectives about technology I'll be exploring are pretty varied:

* Large sea changes in technology - how existing platforms are evolving, and which parts of our world are going to be eaten by software next.
* Ideas and opportunities - problems that I think need to be solved and products I wish existed
* The second order effects of technology changes, large and small, from a social and cultural lens
* The craft of building software
