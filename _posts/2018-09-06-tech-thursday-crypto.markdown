Through **Tech Thursday**, I'll be exploring a few perspectives:
* Large sea changes in technology - how existing platforms are evolving, and which parts of our world are going to be eaten by software next.
* The second order effects of technology changes, large and small, from a social and cultural lens
* Ideas and opportunities - problems that I think need to be solved and products I wish existed
* Personal projects - sharing code and whatever else about software I've hacked together for my own needs

First up: Crypto, and more specifically - the Blockchain.

The blockchain will likely be the foundation for biggest technological changes in the next 20 years. 
The news cycle about crypto revolves around it as the future of money, whereas the most bigger change is the impact it will have on computing.

To understand its potential at this stage requires a first principles approach. It's potential will be realized by the creation of new models, disbanding some old models, and some things that will continue to be important (perhaps more so) in this new world.

Building apps require the creation of new mental models of crypto.
- Non Fungibility
- Decentralization 
- Markets in Everything
- Value Store in Everything 
- Money 2.0
- Tokens

We we also likely have to get rid of some ways of thinking that are defaulted:
- Centralized Login and Signup


And the models that will continue to be important:
- Design centric approaches - especially when consumers have more choice
