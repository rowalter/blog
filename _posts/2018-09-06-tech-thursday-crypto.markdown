Through **Tech Thursday**, I'll be exploring a few perspectives:
* Large sea changes in technology - how existing platforms are evolving, and which parts of our world are going to be eaten by software next.
* The second order effects of technology changes, large and small, from a social and cultural lens
* Ideas and opportunities - problems that I think need to be solved and products I wish existed
* Personal projects - sharing code and whatever else about software I've hacked together for my own needs
