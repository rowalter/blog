There is no shortage of leadership advice in books and articles across the internet (this isn't one of them) - it is about a framework for **learning**. The goal is to provide a structured latticework that can help pick up new skills in the domain of leadership, like tools in a tool box. This approach to learning is similar to that of mental models. 

The framework itself is quite simple - it is a list of all of the domains of leadership, and how they interact with each other as a system. My experience is in that of software startups, but I imagine this can extend outside of that as well. 

The domains are:
- Individuals: The domain of the people, and is concerned with management at an individual level.
- Teams: The domain of how people organize and effectively work together.
- Products: The domain of what people get together to create. The word "product" is used to describe any offering - which could include a service. 
- Markets: The domain of the customers, and is concerned with how products are adopted in market.
- Society: The domain of society, which is concerned with the broader impacts of a product in market.

This is a system in which these domains are highly connected to each other, and they interact with the adjacent ones. Individual impact teams, teams impact products, etc. 

In further posts, i'll expand on each domain. I will also stress test this framework by examining how common leadership practices fit within this framework. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing when and how this breaks.
