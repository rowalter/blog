Notes:
- Companies today have to accept a broader responsibility to develop their people in order to stay competitive in the market.
- Acquiring and retaining talent is the #1 issue for most startups today. But most HR is consumed with the former, without paying much attention to the latter.
- The opportunity for growth through learning and development is the most common reason why people join (and leave) a company.
- Learning infrastructures take a long time to build, and as a startup there's a gap in the market for a turnkey Learning management system.
- Learning goes beyond good content and how it's delivered. It covers: Improving Professional Profile, Building Network and Community, Peer learning, Coaching and Mentorship.

Here's the crux of it for employees:
- Employees don't have time to do this themselves > Need an active approach
- Employees don't have networks and resources > Need to provide access, create connections
- Employees are alone in self betterment
