I've been fortunate to see how companies operate in times of peace vs times of "war". They are both so incredibly different and binary. There is no mistaking when you're in wartime, especially. Many companies feel like they are in wartime until they see what that actually means. 

Here is my perspective on the topic. 

- Wartime is essential but is overapplied. 
- need to volunteer to sign up. 
- set expectations with team. 
- make sure scope is clear
