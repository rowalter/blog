Instead of asking what to do to be more productive, look for what is making you unproductive, and solve those problems. In my case, it's the amount and broad range of commitments not tied to my immediate goals.

So this week I'm forgoing my to-do list for a &quot;not-to-do&quot; list. A list of commitments to cancel, meetings I won't attend, and conversations I no longer need to continue. Also - a reminder that I should _never_ be committing to these things. 

This is something I should be doing more often, but I have a backlog I need to clear. It's time to free up time to focus on what's most important and start saying no more.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Inversion applies well to the productivity problem.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Companies today have to accept a broader responsibility to develop their people in order to stay competitive in the market. This has always been true in a sense, but more pronounced in today’s hiring environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acquiring and retaining talent is the single most important issue for most startups. But, most HR teams are consumed the former (acquisition).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The opportunity for continual growth is the most common reason why people join, stay or leave a company. Learning and development activities are an important pillar of this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning today goes beyond good content and how it’s delivered. It covers the full range of investment that a company is making in an individual. This includes - improving their personal brand, building effective networks, learning through peers, coaching and mentorship.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning infrastructures take a long time to build, and as a startup there’s a gap in the market for a ‘turnkey’ learning management system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Employees are not empowered enough, and often feel alone in self betterment in a startup. They need active approaches, time and budget set aside, and feet in the right doors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most if not all of the tech giants and larger tech companies have very strong infrastructures for continual learning. Many credit company success to those programs.&lt;/li&gt;

Here's one I found really interesting - [How The Raptors Became An Elite NBA Team With Only Non-Lottery Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IGwlu7LkKI). I remember each of these events as a fan, and it's really interesting to see how it all strings together into a broader strategy. Perhaps this is just another example of the past seeming so linear and intentional, but it's a cool story nonetheless.

That gives me 10 minutes to write and publish a post that I haven't even conceived yet.

But for some reason, I'm not worried.

10 minutes is also 600 seconds, a unit shift that adds a different perspective. Some funny math starts to happen - If the fastest person in the world can run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, in 600 seconds they can run 6000 meters. Obviously this isn't true, but the perspective, however flawed, creates abundance from scarcity. This triggers a peace of mind and creates space for focus.

Mental tricks alone aren't enough. A fast approaching deadline is another type of boundary in which creativity can flourish. A boundary that can be manufactured consistently by, well, procrastinating. This is a familiar place - I subconsciously wait for times like this to _force_ creative output.

It would be amazing if I could maintain this pace of output throughout the day. But for now...time's up.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s 11:50 pm.

The Warriors team just didn't do enough to stop our offensive depth, and wasn't able to find the offensive rhythm as a group to keep pace. Curry had a personal playoff record 47 points, but that isn't important anymore.

I'm excited Toronto won, ofcourse. But I also can't get over just _how_ Golden State lost. This game really brought out the true colors of the fanbase. From Warriors Owner Mark Stevens pushing Lowry for no reason when he fell into the sidelines, to fans streaming out 3 minutes before the end of the game. 

It just makes me appreciate how we support this Raptors team, and how our fans have become a critical part of the franchise.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Game 3 was a resounding victory for the Raptors.

These principles are below but the [essay](http://blas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Best-Product-A-Great-Team.pdf) is worth the read many times over.

&gt; 1. Getting the air right - creating and fostering the right environment, the right culture.
&gt; 2. Attracting, retaining, and inspiring the best people, and then giving them the freedom and autonomy to run
&gt; 3. Providing a grand vision which get people to go all-in
&gt; 4. Creating a self-sustaining and self-organizinggroup that can prosper even when the leader steps away.

There's so much energy in the city. Sports does such a great job to set aside differences and bring people together. Toronto is already a friendly city but it feels like we're really banding together to celebrate this, and to recognize our own greatness.

This post is a collection of those [highly disparate] notes.

* **On Shaping Products**: Iconic products have a _shape_. Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are known for their unique takes on the feed. Tinder is about swiping. Messenger apps all have a very specific structure. Products shape around a core and adjacent user problem. To understand the shape your product should take, it's critical to understand those problems and resulting customer funnel.
* **On Major Releases**: Making large changes to a product in market is filled with anxiety and excitement. The former because large changes are necessary, but their success or failure is hard to pinpoint to one specific improvement. Many use this argument to focus on small incremental changes over time. I'm not dogmatic about either approach - but writing off one approach is a fools errand. There is a time and place for large releases. When it's overapplied, it becomes an easy target. But without it, a startup can end up spinning wheels towards local maximums.
* **On Decision Confidence**: Much has been written about decisionmaking frameworks. One I like to use often is the decision confidence rule - if you have 80% of information to make a decision, it's time to make the call. Any more work will be diminishing returns. I find so many product managers scared to use their own earned instinct. This signals a lack of confidence in their own decisions.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve had some great conversations recently about product management.

For the last few weeks I've found myself fall into a familiar pattern - skip writing for a few days (or only write a few notes in a draft), and make up for it by writing 3-4 blog posts in one day. I'm not a fan of this intermittence, but also am happy that I'm keeping pace with a single blog post per day _on average_.

The day after writing 3 or 4 posts, I'm tapped out. So I take a break, and the cycle perpetuates.

I'm not sure exactly how to reposition the habit so it can happen more regularly. Mornings are tough because those are my deep work sessions that I like to use. One way I've seen it work is when I can complete a post right before I leave work.

Anyways, I'm not sure how this habit will regularize itself again - but one thing is clear - writing everyday at EOD isn't working that well. I'm hoping to get this fixed soon.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My writing habit is breaking down in a very strange way.</summary></entry></feed>
