It often comes when starting something new or entering a new domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two exercises that reduce this uncertainty are understanding the &lt;strong&gt;forces at play&lt;/strong&gt; and determining &lt;strong&gt;base rates&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding forces at play is about becoming familiar with the system in which you are operating, so that you may use it to your advantage. Determining a base rate is about looking at history to examine what success (and failure) has looked like in the past, so as to establish a benchmark for your own actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ‘forces at play’ comes from Charlie Munger’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2013/04/munger-two-step/&quot;&gt;two step decision making process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A simple and easy approach to decision making that prevents us from being manipulated:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Understand the forces at play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Understand how your subconscious might be leading you astray.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that first step:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The key to the first step is knowing what you know and what you don’t know. You need to understand your circle of competence. It’s just as important to know what you don’t know as it is to know what you know.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If you know what you don’t know, you might still have to make a decision, but your approaches for making that decision will change. For example, if you’re forced to make a decision in an area that you know is well outside your circle of competence, one tool you can use is inversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forcing ourselves to understand the world around us, especially the ‘unknowns’, will help us harness those forces towards whatever objective we are trying to reach. That second step - to understand our own biases - is another important step especially before making any decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ‘base rates’ comes from statistics. It represents the percentage of a population that exhibit a certain characteristic. It’s most basic use is determining the probability that a member of that population will also have that characteristic. For example, if 40% of immigrants in Canada are from India, then if you choose one immigrant in Canada, they have a 40% chance of being from India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the great lessons from studying history is to do with “base rates”. “Base rate” is a technical term of describing odds in terms of prior probabilities. The base rate of having a drunken-driving accident is higher than those of having accidents in a sober state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the base rates in a new environment helps to determine whether a certain decision you’re considering has worked before or not, or atleast give you a sense of whether it will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these techniques paired together can provide a broader context to how a new unfamiliar system works. One gives a general view of how the system behaves, and another gives insight into how a decision might fare in this system. They are useful on their own, but very powerful when paired together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We all find ourselves in situations sometimes where there’s a high degree of uncertainty in our decisions.

Today they wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usv.com/writing/2019/11/the-education-transformation/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about the state of the education market, and the transformation taking place in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crux of the problem is that education represents the highest growing cost for an average American. It’s become increasingly difficult financially to afford a decent education - ironically at the same time education delivery technology has improved rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Our education portfolio has become a core value driver in our funds. In part, we think this is because we have hit the tipping point in consumers’ interest in self-driven, direct-to-learner education because technology has enabled higher quality education to be delivered at a lower price point, a counter-balance to the inflationary trends we’ve seen to date. Appetite for products and services that reframe what it means to learn – and how to learn – is high, and quickly accelerating. Which is all to say, we’re ready for more and eager to meet the teams that are building the products and platforms that will restructure education.&lt;/p&gt;

This post is about Genghis Khan’s rise to power and what it has to teach us about establishing culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genghis used a decentralized management and speed as his secret weapon against clans much largers than his own army. He also ensured best practices of the places he was conquering were brought into the fold in his army - enabling a culture of continuous learning. There were three principles that helped him create a stable culture: meritocracy, loyalty, and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metitocracy was about destroying the hierarchical and sexist structures of the military in the past. He changed his military structure to operate as concentric circles vs. hierarchies with a consistent chain of command. This allowed him to get rid of those that were there just for status, and promote soliders to leaders if they demonstrated that ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loyalty was a “bilateral relationship”, almost synonymous with trust. It was about having the option to punish someone for not obeying orders, but also not always exercising that option. Genghis wanted to preserve Mongol life even as he was conquering the country, so this was applied universally not just within his army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inclusion was about getting rid of the aristocrats and helping soliders rise up from the bottoms up, thereby building trust and loyalty. This applied to the enemies he conquered too. He also created inclusion by creating new ethical boundaries - he outlawed crimes against women and children - something that was commonly accepted during those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His decentralized approach to creating culture was a revolutionary approach, and although it fell apart because of succession issues, the change he was able to create was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m slow reading What You Do is Who You Are by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section.

This post is about the chapter on Shaka Senghor who spent 20 years incarcerated and led change within that culture of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senghor’s story is long and one of the most interesting chapters in the book. He rose ranks within the Melanics gang in his jail, then challenged it’s leaders on their adherence to their principles. This helped him build the trust of new recruits and eventually the leaders themselves. He used his platform to enact changes in the principles themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key lessons from Sengor apply in the context of someone coming in to change the culture of an organization. In order to do this, one needs to understand some important truths. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture changes people so it’s hard to measure by asking everyone - but the best indicator is those new to the organization. In those first few weeks and months, employees figure out what they need to do to fit in, survive and succeed. If you want to understand your company culture, ask those folks right after those first weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One must live the code. This is an ideal Ben brings up in other chapters too. But in a jail environment, living the code can mean the difference between life or death; stability or chaos. One must put in cultural elements that you actually subscribe to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture is universal. It applies not only to how you treat employees, but also partners, vendors and everyone that your employees come into contact. Your culture travels with them and you need to be prepared to address issues in all those interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture will also get weaponized. People will interpret your code one way, and in an incentive to impress might choose to go to an extreme. It’s difficult to predict all the ways this can happen, but important to react quickly when it does. Often that means a clarification or counterbalancing rule. In Slack’s case, their “empathy” rule was being weaponized to dull negative feedback. So, they changed it to “collaborative”, making it clear that the team outcome is more important than any individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture might require you to change yourself. This is intentional, after all. You are trying to change behaviours of an entire group - this should also apply to you as an individual. Ben provides an example of how he himself ‘weaponized’ his value by equating the truth with simply what was legal. He changed himself and the value so that the emphasis was on the truth being &lt;em&gt;received&lt;/em&gt;, vs. simply just the truth being told. It was a higher bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture requires constant contact. Just like many leadership activities, repetition is the name of the game. It not only creates cadence but reinforces priority.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m slow reading What You Do is Who You Are by Ben Horowitz, and writing a series of posts to capture some key points from each major section.

This post is about how understanding the Bushido code can help build a stronger company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first lesson is the difference between values and virtues; the former being a set of beliefs vs the latter being behaviours, and how Bushido is structured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bushido looks like a set of principles, but it’s a set of practices. The samurai defined culture as a code of action, as system not of values but of virtues. A value is merely a belief, but a virture is a belief that you actively prusue or embody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many corporate cultures center around ‘values’ which immediately makes them ineffective. As Ben states, “what you believe means nearly nothing. What you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; is who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second lesson is on the importance of death. In the samurai context this meant living with the highest degree of honor and attention to your craft, because death can be around any corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The idea is to take care of your public and private duties day and night, and then whenever you have free time when your mind is unoccupied, you think of death, bringing it to mind attentively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a company context keeping death in mind at all times also means thinking about the worst case scenario and planning for what happens next. How do you want your company to be talked about after? How do you want your employees to feel about their time there? Keeping these questions in mind will help you prioritize what’s really important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are eight samurai virtues, the ones discussed in detail in the book were honor, politeness, and veracity or sincerety. Honor is about how you apply your set of standards in an organization - whether it’s with business dealings, product quality, or employee issues. High honor companies are consistent and systematic in their approach. Politeness is about expressing love and respect for those around you. To ensure that politeness didn’t get used to be fake, there was strong emphasis on the truth - expressed in the virtue of sincerety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Why did the bushido have such a profound impact on Japanese society? The complex answer is that the samurai developed and refined their culture continuously over a very long period of time, using a variety of psychologically sophisticated techniques to make it feel indelible, inescapable and completely natural.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The simple answer is that they kept death in mind at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
