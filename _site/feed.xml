&lt;p&gt;I’m a product person, but even I will admit that most of product building is actually &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;. Building products for customers is more about selling than creating. And most of sales is about listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening is knowing you customer. It’s knowing what your customer wants and needs. Sometimes they will tell you that, but most often they won’t. Which is why matching that with a solution is so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first arsenal in your sales toolkit is often just a value proposition. This can be as simple as a statement or visualization of your customer’s problem and your solution. Your value proposition is used anytime you are trying to sell yourself to a customer, investor, or anyone curious about your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;www.basecamp.com&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; has a great value proposition statement. &lt;em&gt;All growing businesses run into the same fundamental problems. Hair on fire, buried under email, stuff everywhere. The good news? &lt;strong&gt;Basecamp solves them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part is about articulating your customer problem - what is their painpoint, or what they want to accomplish with your product or service. A great framework for this is Jobs to be Done, which asks “what job is your customer hiring your product/service for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part flows from the first - it’s a simple expression your solution in a way that it solves that customer problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting ways of breaking this whole process down into vitamins and painkillers, and filling out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://isaacjeffries.com/blog/2018/2/27/how-to-fill-in-a-value-proposition-canvas&quot;&gt;value proposition canvas&lt;/a&gt;. All these are great techniques but the basics are pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">These are notes for a talk I’ll be giving in a few weeks about Value Propositions.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Machines will Run the Financial World</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190731/machines-will-run-the-financial-world.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Machines will Run the Financial World" /><published>2019-07-31T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-31T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190731/machines-will-run-the-financial-world</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190731/machines-will-run-the-financial-world.html">&lt;p&gt;Anthony Pompliano aka “Pomp” is a crypto investor and author of the prolific Off the Chain Substack and podcast.

This post is an outline of the narrative of the first talk about MVPs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building anything is an investment - of time and capital. Investments are probabilistic - which means there is risk involved and a chance that things will fail. Startups in particular have a high failure rate - and over 40% fail because they built something no one cared about - there was no market need. Humans hate risk - it’s scary, but most importantly - failure sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where MVPs come in. Minimum viable products are a framework for derisking investments. MVP’s came from the Lean Startup Movement created by Eric Ries as a framework for launching new startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.” — Eric Ries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An MVP is a way to test the water - a small investment that helps us justify the big investment. It’s a test, not necessarily the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly an MVP has to  be &lt;em&gt;viable&lt;/em&gt; and actually solve the original problem in some way. And that product can be anything - a landing page with a promise, a service provided, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVP’s are about derisking, not eliminating all risk. Minimum viable products exist to help you test a hypothesis but you won’t know all the details until you actually launch. MVP’s can be applied to existing products too, not just new products. There are some examples of &lt;a href=&quot;https://speckyboy.com/successful-minimum-viable-products/&quot;&gt;successful MVP’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software is getting easier to create. Risk to start is getting lower and it’s easier than ever to create a fully functional MVP especially with new tools and the rise of the No Code Movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most successful companies in technology started as MVPs - I’m looking forward to seeing what these students create!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ll be giving a talk at Ryerson for a product management prep course, covering topics like Minimum Viable Products and Defining a Value Proposition.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cloud gaming is the new “thing” in the media industry. Whether it’s a game publisher or platform, there’s constant talk and even more ambition to be the so-called “Netflix of gaming”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Gaming’s reliance on technology platforms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This reliance has several interconnected consequences. First, gaming is more powerfully influenced by technology (and therefore technology change) than other categories. Put another way, business models and content flow more strongly from tech than to technology. Evidence of this is abundant; regardless of whether content or distribution is king, making games under the wrong technological premises will always come back to haunt you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found it useful to change the internal narrative from “I’m feeling anxious” to “I’m experiencing anxiety”. This detaches the feeling from your character.

Some notes from the article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the importance of learning in an organization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Like a biological ecosystem, organizations are either growing or they’re dying. And organizations grow when their employees are learning. So if you want a high-growth organization, you need to create a learning ecosystem to support high-growth individuals — to expose them to new and challenging opportunities before their roles become stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On redeployments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Companies need to see that a high-growth employee who loves to learn is a very valuable asset. Redeploying them on a new learning curve within the organization keeps their expertise in-house and allows them to share and build on it — a potentially exponential gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On other ways of promoting learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Job swapping is only one strategy to put employees on new learning curves, help break down silos, and maximize shared organizational learning. Ongoing training and educational opportunities, job sharing, mentoring and outreach programs are a few other examples. You can get creative in how you mix things up, move people around, and offer employees new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

I heard in a podcast recently that Sleep can be considered the ultimate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic&quot;&gt;nootropic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Without sleep &lt;strong&gt;you can’t form or maintain the pathways in your brain that let you learn&lt;/strong&gt; and create new memories, and it’s harder to concentrate and respond quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sleep is important to a number of brain functions, including how nerve cells (neurons) communicate with each other.  In fact, your brain and body stay remarkably active while you sleep.  Recent findings suggest that sleep plays a housekeeping role that removes toxins in your brain that build up while you are awake.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Everyone needs sleep, but its biological purpose remains a mystery. &lt;strong&gt;Sleep affects almost every type of tissue and system in the body – from the brain, heart, and lungs to metabolism, immune function, mood, and disease resistance.&lt;/strong&gt;  Research shows that a chronic lack of sleep, or getting poor quality sleep, increases the risk of disorders including high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great resource on Sleep is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316&quot;&gt;Why we Sleep&lt;/a&gt; by Matthew Walker.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’m not feeling well, so this is a very short post about the importance of sleep.

&lt;p&gt;This problem is even more pronounced given there are many more successful companies - more unicorns and IPOs than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not sustainable and can be resolved by the creation of more qualified talent (through training and development programs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also serve as a forcing function to build and create high performing productive teams. We are already seeing innovation in ways of managing teams and building products as a result of this. The growth of remote work is a perfect example of this, as is the nocode movement. However there is no single cookie cutter solution yet and it will emerge from the crowd of companies innovating their way around this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There’s a large disparity between available capital (abundant) and available talent (scarce).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most people now believe the best “risky investments” will continue to be equity and equity-like investments, such as leveraged private equity, leveraged real estate, and venture capital, and this is especially true when central banks are reflating. As a result, the world is leveraged long, holding assets that have low real and nominal expected returns that are also providing historically low returns relative to cash returns (because of the enormous amount of money that has been pumped into the hands of investors by central banks and because of other economic forces that are making companies flush with cash). I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold. Additionally, for reasons I will explain in the near future, most investors are underweighted in such assets, meaning that if they just wanted to have a better balanced portfolio to reduce risk, they would have more of this sort of asset. For this reason, I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one’s portfolio. I will soon send out an explanation of why I believe that gold is an effective portfolio diversifier.&lt;/p&gt;
