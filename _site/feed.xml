In their most recent summit, they issued a startement committing to a new purpose of a corporation (since 1997, this has been to serve shareholders, and to maximize shareholder value). The new mandate includes this, but also some other &lt;a href=&quot;https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/&quot;&gt;committments&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Delivering value to our customers. We will further the tradition of American companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer expectations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Investing in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. We are dedicated to serving as good partners to the other companies, large and small, that help us meet our missions.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Generating long-term value for shareholders, who provide the capital that allows companies to invest, grow and innovate. We are committed to transparency and effective engagement with shareholders.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Each of our stakeholders is essential. We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am immediately reminded of the &lt;a href=&quot;/20181020/leadership-lattice-simplified.html&quot;&gt;leadership lattice&lt;/a&gt; - a mental model for &lt;em&gt;how companies work&lt;/em&gt; and leader’s role within it. The lattice describes how leaders have to manage their attention towards individual growth, team productivity, the product of their effort, the extent of impact in their market, and the second order effects of that impact. This broader responsibility is reflected in this mandate as well with some level of committment from the CEO’s of these orgs. While it feels reactionary and a bit late - it’s a step in the right direction. Let’s see if something actually changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Since 1997, a group of CEO’s of the biggest American corporations have been getting together in an annual Business Roundtable summit.

Which I think is an apt analogy. It’s a first principles approach - think about the largest item on a startup financial statement and rent is probably high up there. WeWork turns a fixed cost into a variable expense based on usage, allowing startups to allocate their capital to what matters more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is nothing more fixed than real estate, yet WeWork’s offering transforms real estate into a variable cost for all kinds of companies, with benefits that roughly mirror public clouds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;New companies can have instant access to a well-appointed office space and pay for only a desk or two, and then grow as needed.
Growing companies do not need to spend time on extensive build-outs months or years ahead of future growth, and instead pay for more space as they need it.
Established companies no longer need to have a real estate competency all over the world, and can in fact expand to new territories with far less risk than previously required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really interesting take and could very well become true, but still a massive leap of faith. WeWork’s financial and operational red flags cannot be ignored. As Ben himself wrote, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stratechery.com/2019/why-wework-isnt-aws-and-the-ceo-problem-cloudflares-s-1-contrasting-s-1s/&quot;&gt;leadership matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ben Thompson from Stratechery makes the bull case for the WeWork IPO, and compares it to the AWS business.

&lt;p&gt;The first wave of marketplaces has been about setting up intermediaries between suppliers and customers across different industries. Sometimes the supply has come from existing sources (e.g. Expedia for Hotels and Flights), and other times a marketplace distinguishes itself because of a unique form of supply (Airbnb, Uber). Customers obviously benefit from convenience and access to this supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For suppliers, these intermediaries did well to establish a source of revenue that perhaps didn’t exist before - e.g. for drivers of UberX, hosts on Airbnb. In many cases, that has become a significant portion of personal income and there are countless stories of people leaving their day jobs. These folks are often makers, creators and entrepreneurs in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as these intermediaries become more powerful, they often do things to drive marketplace value, (or sometimes, just in the name of customer centricity) that ends up harming these suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I believe will end up happening is a new crop of companies that exist solely to help these entrepreneurs operate as independent entities. These companies will provide suppliers with what the marketplaces do - the ability to reach customers, manage the customer relationship, and ensure that their customers are being fulfilled. This is already well underway in retail (Shopify being the clear example here), but also in journalism (Substack), Food delivery (Dumpling), and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how I believe &lt;em&gt;decentralization&lt;/em&gt; takes place - through a slow erosion trust in intermediaries that are acting to optimize the overall marketplace versus trying to make their suppliers successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In future posts, I’ll explore how trust in the intermediary gets eroded on the customer end, and what opportunities that will create.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Some disconnected thoughts about marketplaces, decentralization and trust:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Diversifying Well</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190817/diversifying-well.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Diversifying Well" /><published>2019-08-17T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-17T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190817/diversifying-well</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190817/diversifying-well.html">&lt;p&gt;This has been a bonkers week for the stock &lt;a href=&quot;https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=^DJI&quot;&gt;market&lt;/a&gt;. It’s timely to read an essay like the one Ray Dalio published recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/diversifying-well-most-important-thing-you-need-do-order-ray-dalio/?published=t&quot;&gt;Diversifying Well Is the Most Important Thing You Need to Do in Order to Invest Well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason comes down to two principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Extreme moves in markets and economies are largely self-correcting, because when they happen, they set into motion adjustments that tend to reverse those extremes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People tend to extrapolate what they have gotten used to. As a result, after an extended period of a certain type of market and economic behavior (a paradigm), it is likely to be “discounted” or “priced in” to the markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining these two highlights why diversification is most important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Because of those last two principles combined—and because policy makers tend to move to reverse extremes in the markets and economies—we have big reversals and big paradigm shifts in markets and economies. It is also why having a well-diversified portfolio that is rebalanced to maintain that diversification has a much better expected return-risk ratio than any single investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a great question that provoked a number of thoughts, and I decided to write out my replies as a blog post itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, writing creates deeper comprehension. Learning and expressing a readable opinion is a great forcing function for understanding any topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing also teaches brevity and the art of getting to the point. Infact, writing is more often &lt;em&gt;removing&lt;/em&gt; words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing as a habit has taught me about myself - my default systems and common excuses. This is likely the byproduct of a the daily commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, writing has become an instrument to do work. It’s not exactly learning, but there’s a ton of value here. I often end meetings saying, ‘I’m going to write about this’, and that post has lasting value (and a nice reminder of our interaction).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today, I received a message from a friend asking, “What have you learned from writing on your blog regularly?”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Trends in Seed Investing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190811/seed-investing-trends.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trends in Seed Investing" /><published>2019-08-11T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-08-11T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190811/seed-investing-trends</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190811/seed-investing-trends.html">&lt;p&gt;Tom Tunguz recently shared some &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomtunguz.com/which-categories-of-seed-startups-are-thriving-which-aren-t/&quot;&gt;data and insights on seed investing trends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In that discussion, I’ll be talking about how MVP’s are a framework for de-risking startup investments. In the early stages of a startup, the risk of getting to product market fit is the largest (but not only) reason why most startups fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across this article about startup risk authored by Kanyi Maqubela - &lt;a href=&quot;https://kanyi.blog/2018/10/18/classical-risk-vs-quantum-risk/&quot;&gt;classic risk vs. quantum risk&lt;/a&gt; - and it summarizes the &lt;em&gt;weight&lt;/em&gt; of product/market fit risk really well - essentially, the risk associated with P/M fit is so much higher than all other risks associated with activities in that stage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What does that mean for company formation? What if risk, as a function of milestones, looked less like classical mechanics, where there can be continuous, curve-like de-risking in time? What if all of the activity that comes along with building a company does not in fact de-risk it? What if product market-fit is in fact the only discrete state in the early stage that de-risks a company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you can de-risk an early stage venture through in many different ways but only P/M fit matters. Simply put, if you haven’t built the right product for the right people &lt;em&gt;at the right time&lt;/em&gt;, nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve been thinking about early stage startup risk especially in working on the presentations about minimum viable products.

&lt;p&gt;Why not try to solve both these problems together, by building a service to accelerate the path of validation for those with great product ideas - in partnership with a trusted group of product experts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Performance marketing to target the right consumer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reporting and analytics on how well the MVP did, with a recommendation for whether they want to continue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a product person, but even I will admit that most of product building is actually &lt;em&gt;sales&lt;/em&gt;. Building products for customers is more about selling than creating. And most of sales is about listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening is knowing you customer. It’s knowing what your customer wants and needs. Sometimes they will tell you that, but most often they won’t. Which is why matching that with a solution is so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first arsenal in your sales toolkit is often just a value proposition. This can be as simple as a statement or visualization of your customer’s problem and your solution. Your value proposition is used anytime you are trying to sell yourself to a customer, investor, or anyone curious about your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href=&quot;www.basecamp.com&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; has a great value proposition statement. &lt;em&gt;All growing businesses run into the same fundamental problems. Hair on fire, buried under email, stuff everywhere. The good news? &lt;strong&gt;Basecamp solves them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part is about articulating your customer problem - what is their painpoint, or what they want to accomplish with your product or service. A great framework for this is Jobs to be Done, which asks “what job is your customer hiring your product/service for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part flows from the first - it’s a simple expression your solution in a way that it solves that customer problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some interesting ways of breaking this whole process down into vitamins and painkillers, and filling out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://isaacjeffries.com/blog/2018/2/27/how-to-fill-in-a-value-proposition-canvas&quot;&gt;value proposition canvas&lt;/a&gt;.
