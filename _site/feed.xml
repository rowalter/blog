We create abstractions to simplify working within them. For example,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strategy” is an abstraction for the collective of short and long term decisions to win in a market. 
“Operations” is an abstraction for the sum of working norms in place towards some enterprise output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s “Culture”, probably the most misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Culture is an abstraction for the sum of all interactions between people in an organization. Often articulated as a set of “Values”, this encompasses everything from everyday decision making to creating a sense of belonging and psychological safety. The broadest definition of culture is all-encompassing, and that’s perhaps why it’s interpreted in so many ways across companies. Today, it’s normal to see a company culture&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I read a really good blog post by Casey Winters, CPO at Eventbrite, who wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://caseyaccidental.com/cultural-values/&quot;&gt;cultural values&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he describes how cultural values are better described on a &lt;em&gt;spectrum&lt;/em&gt; rather than on their own. For example, on the spectrum of speed vs. quality, Facebook encourages it’s employees to bias towards speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of culture is reflected in decision making, which in itself is an exercise in evaluating trade-offs. Cultural values should be clear about those trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Companies are complex systems.

&lt;p&gt;The first direction is horizontal expansion to offer more financial products (e.g. insurances, mortgages, loans, etc). This is the most common approach. Investment service providers expand to offer different savings and investment products. A good example is Wealthfront - known for it’s investment platform, which also now offers bridge loans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second vector is verticalization, i.e. to own more of the customer experience upto the point of creating financial products. This applies to fintech’s that are mostly discovery / referral businesses. Verticalization means owning the application process and providing the financial product itself (i.e. a loan or insurance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the above approaches lead to a fintech turning into a neo-bank (a digital native financial service provider).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third vector is geographic expansion. This approach requires an investment in regulatory compliance but is a relatively smaller investment than a bank establishing branches overseas. This is less common but there are some good examples of this - Wealthsimple in Canada operates in the US and UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three examples have a common thread - take a digital first, customer driven approach to financial services and compete on &lt;em&gt;simplicity&lt;/em&gt; to get the financial products.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Some thoughts about common growth and expansion vectors for Fintech startups.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Travel Decentralized</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190908/travel-decentralized.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Travel Decentralized" /><published>2019-09-08T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-08T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190908/travel-decentralized</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190908/travel-decentralized.html">&lt;p&gt;I live to travel. I love that tech has made it easy to experience the world, whether its through instant online booking, social recommendations or home-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the convenience is great, I do miss parts of the travel agent experience. I miss the ability to contact someone that understands your travel preference, can find you things you might not have been looking for, and make the process of travel planning more fun than work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tech has done is taken a fragmented supply (flights, hotels, etc) and make it really easy for the customer to make the best choices at the cheapest cost. In similar ways to other marketplaces, those suppliers now depend on travel bookings by these sites and advertise good reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I wonder if there’s a need for a product to help those travel agents become more successful, and to help people &lt;em&gt;become&lt;/em&gt; travel agents. I have friends with amazing taste that refer people to travel destinations without participating in any upside for that referral. It would be really interesting to see a product that helps them participate in that; I think it’s worth it for all sides involved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I live to travel.

This is a simple principle but incredible difficult to execute in practice. I’m sharing the method I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I start with writing my global priorities. For me this is - my physical and mental health, the well being of my family and friends, and then the things that give me professional and creative fulfillment. Within this structure, I put down the tasks that I need to do during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for my physical and mental health - this is working out, a short meditation and writing. 
For my family, these are the things to maintain and improve my most important personal relationships. 
For professional fulfillment, these are the things I do at work with a team trying to realize a collective vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I start working on them in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means I start my day with a workout, meditation, and writing. Then, I do the family &amp;amp; friends stuff - whether it’s ordering diapers on Amazon or getting back in touch with someone. And then I move on to work tasks, which I also &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only applies to weekdays. Weekends follow a very different structure when you have kids. This isn’t perfect and I still get distracted (noting when that happens is also critical). But I really appreciate getting the most important things done first.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I made a small adjustment to my planning routine recently - to simply do things in priority order.

It’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://hfo.futureland.tv/&quot;&gt;a new way to learn anything&lt;/a&gt;, and recently launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetvin.com/2019/09/06/futureland-support-packs/&quot;&gt;Futureland Support Packs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support Packs are a way to fund the development of the project, which is currently a solo-effort by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/internetvin&quot;&gt;InternetVin&lt;/a&gt;. He says it best in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://internetvin.com/2019/09/06/futureland-support-packs/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Futureland has demonstrated that it can be an effective tool for someone to learn new skills and stick to long term projects. I receive positive feedback on this project every day. But can Futureland continue to sustain itself? At this point, Futureland is entirely created and supported by me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I started to wonder, how Futureand could ask for support in a way that (1) was respectful of early user support through their time and energy. And (2) recognizes that Futureland is still very much a product in development and therefore should not be priced like a final product.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The solution I came to was this concept of optional support for existing users. If users want and are in a position to support Futureland, they can. I created a few different methods to do that. Some are simple like a $20 pledge and others include cool products like a limited full-sleeve Futureland tee.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;I will always be experimenting with new ways to sustain and expand Futureland while being respectful to its earliest users. The vision is to create a tool that makes it a little easier for any one on Earth to learn anything.&lt;/p&gt;

These are some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with &lt;a href=&quot;/20180902/self-curiosity.html&quot;&gt;self curiosity&lt;/a&gt;. Try to understand your daily energy levels (what time of day you are most productive), and design your day around that. That will be a quick win that will help you understand how to replicate productive times throughout the day. I started this by &lt;a href=&quot;/20180918/time-tracking-update.html&quot;&gt;logging my time&lt;/a&gt; for an extended period to observe where it was being spent. Spend time to look back - I do &lt;a href=&quot;/20180911/productivity-planning-retros.html&quot;&gt;retrospectives&lt;/a&gt; on a regular basis to find patterns and ways I can improve. When you find out time is being spent in a way, or a time you don’t want it to - try to take it back. It’s yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improving &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; requires as much intention as improving &lt;em&gt;your work&lt;/em&gt;. Remember that you and your work are two separate things. Externalizing yourself from your work allows you to stay calm. A good tool is to understand the emotional triggers that lead you into time-consuming thought patterns (stress, intense excitement). I do this with an anxiety journal where I write down “what happened” and “how it made me feel”. The act of noting these triggers itself relieves stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By nature, this list will get better over time as I learn more about myself and what makes me productive and happy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I had a really great conversation today about managing time, and ended up going over some of my most important learnings about productivity over the last year.

Across industries, dual-sided marketplaces have untapped latent demand or better utilized supply and created really interesting businesses along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As marketplaces grow, consumers come to expect the benefits of economies of scale - better selection, price and overall fulfillment experience. As producers become more savvy, they will want to exercise more control over the entire customer experience. Ultimately, as entrepreneurs, most of them will want to own that customer relationship themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a choice that defines the identity the marketplace - to focus on building the largest end-customer base, or to focus on helping sellers become the most successful. There are of course examples where building for both can work for an extended period of time, but managing &lt;a href=&quot;/20190710/maintaining-equilibrium-marketplace-development.html&quot;&gt;equlibrium&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly difficult as marketplaces scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Marketplaces are a great place for consumers and producers to come together online.

&lt;p&gt;The funnel has been the dominant mental model to understand product performance for software startups. It was coined by Dave McClure of 500 Startups fame, and describes a customer journey through a product, from the channel they arrived to the point they start paying you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lot of software, this experience encapsulated the user journey well enough, and funnels became the most common model to measure startup health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They highlight some important measures of success. The proportions of users that make it through each step, especially over a time-series, can give us a really good understanding of how well a specific part of the business is doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that funnels are still an incomplete model. A funnel is simply one part of the flywheel,  and only operates in a single direction. We know how much things are happening, but don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more complete model for growing products is the &lt;em&gt;flywheel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flywheel is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph#Directed_cycle_graph&quot;&gt;cyclical graph&lt;/a&gt;, where each node represents a key event or user action that drives the business forward. This makes them a more complete way of understanding how a business actually grows, by tying together the events that create continued usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best products create flywheel effects where the effects of one event can cause that event to happen again. For example, a user joining a social network might interact with some content and share it to someone outside the network, causing someone new to join the network, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple example but in reality, the nuanced events that drive businesses forward are pretty fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this newsletter I intend to explore fast growing businesses across industries, and also look at some already successful businesses retrospectively to examine how they grew through the lens of a flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Cross-posted from Flywheels.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A New Writing Project</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190901/flywheels.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A New Writing Project" /><published>2019-09-01T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-01T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190901/flywheels</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190901/flywheels.html">&lt;p&gt;I’m starting another writing project - this one is a newsletter called Flywheels, and I will be hosting it on Substack.

It’s disgusting but not surprising; Canada is not immune to blatant state-sponsored racism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is the immigrant experience, but probably not the typical one. I’ve gone through so many visas and statuses I’ve lost count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came to Canada in 1997 on a diplomatic visa, and started school at the University of Waterloo. I transferred to a student visa, and also did a number of co-op terms in the United States (on a J1 training visa) at Amazon.com in Seattle. I had all intentions of moving to the US. But, the visa for my last co-op term wasn’t granted because the Embassy deemed I had spent “too many terms” in the US, and needed to go back to my country of citizenship (India) to apply my training for atleast two years. That wasn’t an option, so I stayed in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 2003, and there weren’t too many tech companies around. I called and emailed over 250 companies in two weeks looking for a technical internship starting immediately. Only one company answered - Tira Wireless - and that’s where I worked for my last term and as my first full time job. At Tira, I moved from a work visa and started my application for permanent residence. I officially landed as an immigrant around 2009, and a citizen a few years later. In total, the nerve-wracking process took almost 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration is a tense process, and every step is a small win towards the life you want to live. It also creates loyalties around those that helped you along the way. Tira is no longer around, but I’ll always remember it as the company that supported and sponsored in this important transition in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There’s been some uproar online about the People’s Party billboards that popped up in Toronto recently, decrying mass immigration.
