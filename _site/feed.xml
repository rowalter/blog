&gt; The most important lessons from history are the takeaways that are so broad they can apply to other fields, other eras, and other people. That’s where lessons have leverage and are most likely to apply to your own life.

Here are some of the my takeaways and favorite snippets:

Lesson 1: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.
&gt; People suffering from sudden, unexpected hardship are likely to adopt views they previously thought unthinkable ... Hard times make people do and think things they’d never imagine when things are calm.

Lesson 2: It takes a special kind of crazy.
&gt; Reversion to the mean occurs because people persuasive enough to make something grow don’t have the kind of personalities that allow them to stop before pushing too far ... Being right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works. 

Lesson 3: Things sometimes look like they're getting better when they're actually getting worse.
&gt; Unsustainable things can last longer than you anticipate. Identifying that something is unsustainable does not provide much information on when that thing will stop. This happens because of incentives and storytelling. Incentives are often tied to maintaining only one part of a system, not a whole system (see: ratings agencies, mortgage brokers during credit crisis). Storytelling because if enough people believe something is true, unsustainable ideas can gain durable life support.

Lesson 4: Progress happens too slowly for people to notice; setbacks happen too fast for people to ignore.
&gt; The irony is that growth – if you can stick around – is a more powerful force, because it compounds. But setbacks capture greater attention because they happen suddenly ... Understanding the speed differences between growth and loss explains a lot of things, from why pessimism is seductive to why long-term thinking is so hard.

Lesson 5: Wounds heal, scars last.
&gt; Those who survive calamities – an important distinction – have a remarkable ability to adapt and rebuild. It’s often far greater than you expect it to be at the end of the calamity. But there’s a big difference between a wound healing and a scar remaining. 

&gt; We can see and measure just about everything in the world except people’s moods, fears, hopes, grudges, goals, triggers, and expectations. That’s partly why history is such a continuous chain of baffling events, and always will be.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Pretty great post from Morgan Housel on the Collaborative Fund blog.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Deflation</title><link href="/20190610/deflation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Deflation" /><published>2019-06-10T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-10T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/20190610/deflation</id><content type="html" xml:base="/20190610/deflation.html">One point.

So much anticipation and energy carried us to this point; the city was ready for a celebration. It feels like someone took the ground beneath us, but we're still floating waiting for the drop. I feel deflated, and need to rest.

Good things don't come easy, definitely not for Toronto.

Instead of asking what to do to be more productive, look for what is making you unproductive, and solve those problems. In my case, it's the amount and broad range of commitments not tied to my immediate goals.

So this week I'm forgoing my to-do list for a &quot;not-to-do&quot; list. A list of commitments to cancel, meetings I won't attend, and conversations I no longer need to continue. Also - a reminder that I should _never_ be committing to these things. 

This is something I should be doing more often, but I have a backlog I need to clear. It's time to free up time to focus on what's most important and start saying no more.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Inversion applies well to the productivity problem.

- Companies today have to accept a broader responsibility to develop their people in order to stay competitive in the market. This has always been true in a sense, but more pronounced in today's hiring environment.
- Acquiring and retaining talent is the single most important issue for most startups. But, most HR teams are consumed the former (acquisition).
- The opportunity for continual growth is the most common reason why people join, stay or leave a company. Learning and development activities are an important pillar of this. 
- Learning today goes beyond good content and how it's delivered. It covers the full range of investment that a company is making in an individual. This includes - improving their personal brand, building effective networks, learning through peers, coaching and mentorship.
- Learning infrastructures take a long time to build, and as a startup there's a gap in the market for a 'turnkey' learning management system.
- Employees are not empowered enough, and often feel alone in self betterment in a startup. They need active approaches, time and budget set aside, and feet in the right doors.
- Most if not all of the tech giants and larger tech companies have very strong infrastructures for continual learning. Many credit company success to those programs.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A few unstructured notes on learning in startups today:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Long Game</title><link href="/20190607/the-long-game.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Long Game" /><published>2019-06-07T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-06-07T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/20190607/the-long-game</id><content type="html" xml:base="/20190607/the-long-game.html">I'm on my way to watch Game 4, and ended up in a wormhole of basketball analysis videos on Youtube.

Here's one I found really interesting - [How The Raptors Became An Elite NBA Team With Only Non-Lottery Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IGwlu7LkKI). I remember each of these events as a fan, and it's really interesting to see how it all strings together into a broader strategy. Perhaps this is just another example of the past seeming so linear and intentional, but it's a cool story nonetheless.

That gives me 10 minutes to write and publish a post that I haven't even conceived yet.

But for some reason, I'm not worried.

10 minutes is also 600 seconds, a unit shift that adds a different perspective. Some funny math starts to happen - If the fastest person in the world can run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, in 600 seconds they can run 6000 meters. Obviously this isn't true, but the perspective, however flawed, creates abundance from scarcity. This triggers a peace of mind and creates space for focus.

Mental tricks alone aren't enough. A fast approaching deadline is another type of boundary in which creativity can flourish. A boundary that can be manufactured consistently by, well, procrastinating. This is a familiar place - I subconsciously wait for times like this to _force_ creative output.

It would be amazing if I could maintain this pace of output throughout the day. But for now...time's up.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s 11:50 pm.

The Warriors team just didn't do enough to stop our offensive depth, and wasn't able to find the offensive rhythm as a group to keep pace. Curry had a personal playoff record 47 points, but that isn't important anymore.

I'm excited Toronto won, ofcourse. But I also can't get over just _how_ Golden State lost. This game really brought out the true colors of the fanbase. From Warriors Owner Mark Stevens pushing Lowry for no reason when he fell into the sidelines, to fans streaming out 3 minutes before the end of the game. 

It just makes me appreciate how we support this Raptors team, and how our fans have become a critical part of the franchise.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Game 3 was a resounding victory for the Raptors.

These principles are below but the [essay](http://blas.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Best-Product-A-Great-Team.pdf) is worth the read many times over.

&gt; 1. Getting the air right - creating and fostering the right environment, the right culture.
&gt; 2. Attracting, retaining, and inspiring the best people, and then giving them the freedom and autonomy to run
&gt; 3. Providing a grand vision which get people to go all-in
&gt; 4. Creating a self-sustaining and self-organizinggroup that can prosper even when the leader steps away.
&gt; 5. Invert! Always Invert - As important as what to do is what _not to do_.</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I recently came across this excellent essay by Blas Moros about the principles that guide great teams.
