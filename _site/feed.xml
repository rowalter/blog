Banks with excessive fees and loan providers with excessive interest are making this problem so much worse. Earnin provides a no-fee service that gives people access to capital as soon as they work, so they don’t have to wait until the biweekly Friday pay-cycle. The notion of a ‘payday’ means that companies are withholding access to money so that &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can put it to work versus the people it’s owed to. It’s great that Earnin is trying to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think about some of the cycles that modern society is seemingly stuck in. Some that are top of mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The daily 9-5 cycle, created as a by-product of the industrial revolution but no longer relevant in a knowledge economy. Within this is also the daily commute cycle, a 2-3 hour block of lost productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cycle of higher education as the only path to unlock success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cycle of reactive, symptom-focused care perpetuated by the modern medical industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are norms that have been perfected for years for us to inherit. But, the internet has given us infrastructure to pass information and value in real time, so it’s time to apply first-principles thinking and think of the best solutions to these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was listening to The Hustler’s Guide to Gettin’ Paid, and the CEO of Earnin was talking about how a alarming 40% of American’s don’t have access to $400 if they needed it for an unexpected expense.

It’s a behind-the-scenes look at Bill’s life - focusing on his work at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, but also covers his childhood, his work at Microsoft, reading habits and much more. It’s pretty fascinating, and I will probably watch it a few times. This is a post of a few things I took away from the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Gates is a first principles thinker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When designing the next generation &lt;em&gt;toilet&lt;/em&gt;, he approaches the problem with a few unchangable restrictions. In this case, it’s the current conditions of the places where these toilets are needed the most - especially the lack of electricity and running water. The foundation ran a contest to encourage innovation around a toilet that doesn’t require running water, access to electricity, and where the byproduct can be re-used instead of being dumped into rivers and lakes. These next generation toilets are being produced and deployed around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Gates uses mental models for everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Melinda Gates says it best - “[Bill] makes a framework in his mind, and then starts slotting in the information. If something doesn’t line up, he gets very frustrated.” He uses frameworks to understand complex topics and then devours as much information as he can to complete that model. Mental models create simple structures to understand the real world, which are essential to linking the facts together. I’m guessing that’s why he’s most often the smartest guy in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many other learnings - on the habits he’s formed to devour and retain information, his sense of competition, and also the incredible privelege that allowed for him to explore his interests throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Bill Gates documentary series was released on Netflix on Friday.

It started with Michael Burry declaring that index investing is a bubble similar to the collateralized debt obligations (CDO’s) that brought down the global economy in 2007. The simple premise is that ETF’s mostly invest in larger companies, and small cap stocks are being thereby being “neglected”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As money pours into exchange-traded funds and other index-tracking products that skew toward big companies, Burry says smaller value stocks are being unduly neglected around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Hunt from &lt;a href=&quot;www.epsilontheory.com&quot;&gt;Epsilon Theory&lt;/a&gt; points out the bias in that statement in his article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epsilontheory.com/ive-got-a-secret/&quot;&gt;I’ve Got a Secret&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Burry – like every small cap value investor since the dawn of time – is saying that the market doesn’t appreciate the information &lt;strong&gt;he’s&lt;/strong&gt; uncovered about his small cap value stocks, and that there are structural reasons why the market doesn’t appreciate that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say the bubble is in the prevailing “always be buying” mentality that surrounds passive investment strategies. That strategy states - passive investing always beats active investing, that stocks always goes up in the long term, buying and holding for the long term without picking individual stocks is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is true &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, it may not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; be true. Passive investment is not a way to shortcut independent thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is different about today’s stock market that didn’t really exist even 10 years ago is the volume of investment information and commentary (thanks to Twitter), and the ease of participating in the market (thanks to so many fintechs). At a macro level the narrative makes sense: that the contrarian path is to move away from passive vehicles, because everyone already knows that’s the best form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wealthfront also recently published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wealthfront.com/the-myth-of-the-passive-investing-bubble/&quot;&gt;Myth of the Passive Investment Bubble&lt;/a&gt;, and referenced an &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.wealthfront.com/indexing-worse-than-marxism/&quot;&gt;earlier article&lt;/a&gt; from 2016, which states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To be sure, index investors are free riders.  They do receive the benefits that result from active trading without bearing the costs.  But free riding on price signals provided by others is hardly a flaw of the capitalist system; it is an essential feature of that system.  In a free-market economy we all benefit from relying on a set of market prices that are determined by others.&lt;/p&gt;

As we begin to understand something more - whether it’s a new language, skill or domain - the questions we ask about the unknowns in that domain become more specific and in most senses, better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found this especially true when learning code. Initially, I start trying to solve problems by asking general questions like “why doesn’t this button do this thing that I want it to?”. It’s difficult to find answers to questions like that, and often leads to dead ends. When that’s happening enough, that’s a great signal that maybe I don’t understand the &lt;em&gt;basics&lt;/em&gt; of a specific domain as well as I should. Often this happens because of an incomplete glossary or understanding of the larger system in which my code is operating. When I develop that, my questions become more precise, stack traces become more understandable, and answers become easier to find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this learning ability is relevant to code, it applies in almost very domain, and I often end up assessing my question quality as a measure of how well I understand something.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Question quality is a good signal to measure progress whenever learning something new.

Such great storytelling about the different dimensions of the financial collapse in 2007, told through the lens of a prescient few that actually benefitted from the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminded me a bit of what’s going on in today’s economic environment where capital is at an all time high, reflected in frothy valuations across private and public markets. There are a lot of signals that the party is going to end soon, but who knows. I don’t have a crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also made me think about the fragility of centralized institutions - corporations and governments alike. Businesses operate trying to maintaining an equilibrium between supply and demand to keep innovating. Governments feel permanent but are also just constructed institutions that have real flaws. Right now, many governments are waking up to a threat to their sovereignty that they have never dealt with before - delvaluation of their money due to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Libra has actually done them a favor in attaching a singular body to the face of global cryptocurrency, and governments around the world are now actively blocking it through regulation. Bitcoin, created over a decade ago, still grows strong because there isn’t any one target to block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, in the face of upcoming risk, the safest place to be is a place of &lt;em&gt;self awareness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;self reliance&lt;/em&gt;, to a place of personal antifragility. We can weather any storm when our futures are not tied to those of a larger institution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Big Short is one of my favorite movies.

&lt;p&gt;Companies are sharing more than they ever have before. Companies are openly sharing their best practices. Open source is the foundation upon which startups today are built. Patents are somewhat irrelevant for software startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of “company secrets” is dated in the world of the open internet. I’ll go so far as to say companies often just hold &lt;em&gt;paper secrets&lt;/em&gt; protected by NDA’s that aren’t really enforcable. This includes everything from internal practices, technology to financial secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Information flows freely in private and public channels. Infact, CEO’s are the new celebrities, openly talking about how their organizations work on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open startups have embraced this shift, infact using openness as an opportunity for increased accountability. There is more benefit from being open than not, and open can even become a competitive advantage when it’s compounded over time. I think of companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.basecamp.com&quot;&gt;Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; - built on open source technology they founded, and to this day actively sharing their best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, enterprise software hasn’t modelled this construct just yet, or atleast at scale. Slack is doing this this with shared channels, but for some reason that hasn’t really taken off. Creating an environment of learning together, especially between trusted organizations, I believe is a powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A few disconnected throughts about the concept of company secrets and open startups.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Our Grouped Future</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190914/our-grouped-future.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Our Grouped Future" /><published>2019-09-14T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-14T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190914/our-grouped-future</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190914/our-grouped-future.html">&lt;p&gt;A16 recently published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://a16z.com/2019/09/06/china-is-cashing-in-on-group-chats/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on how Chinese companies are using group chat interfaces for everything from customer service, education, commerce and travel. It makes a lot of sense. Group chats are often trusted digital spaces full of high-intent users, often because they self select to become a part of the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From chatbots to shopping via smart speaker, previous modes of conversational commerce have largely failed to live up to the hype in the US. But perhaps the reason is not that we are still waiting for next-generation technology; rather, we’ve been viewing commerce too narrowly, as an individual experience. Group chats set up by businesses don’t have to feel transactional; to users, such chats can feel more like interest groups than one-on-one sales pitches. They can provide community and crowdsourced knowledge in an organic way while simultaneously helping the brand behind them build trust and sell products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group chats are already huge in India. Whatsapp has optimized for communication to flow between group chats - accelerated by a very prominent “forward” button on images and video. Information spreads between groups so things can spread exponentially faster than individual sharing. This has some clear downfalls, especially when political and medical misinformation is spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groups are the primary construct in which people socialize in a mobile-first world, and I think it’s only a matter of time until major platforms open up a bit more to allow for some innovation in these spaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A16 recently published a post on how Chinese companies are using group chat interfaces for everything from customer service, education, commerce and travel.
