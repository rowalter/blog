The topic went in many directions, but we talked for a while about company building and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked a question that I’ve asked myself in my quest to learn how to become a more effective leader - &lt;em&gt;what is a company&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get to that, a short diatribe about the current state of leadership advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership advice surrounds us in the tech community. It’s everywhere. It’s amazing that people from different companies at different stages are openly sharing their lessons in an effort to make us better. But that’s made for information overload. The problem of “popular advice” has never been worse. Popularity is a horrible proxy for many things, but especially so for advice. It creates recency bias and results in misapplying tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion I’ve reached is leadership advice needs to be received with more structure. All advice needs a mental framework in our minds, so we can use the right tools for the right jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That framework for me is the company system - people, organizing as teams, creating some output, received by a market, which done enough, produces impact. It translates the line between an individual and impact. There’s nuance around governance and company stage that needs to be considered, but for the most part the simple structure is an incredibly useful mental model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simple framework also helps me place advice, and I look to challenge it everytime I learn something new (reading a new book, or a blog post).&lt;/p&gt;

I really enjoyed reading this one. These are some of my favorite captions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fact that &lt;strong&gt;this isn’t new&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The truth is that the U.S. China relationship has been extremely one-sided for a very long time now: China buys the hardware it needs, and keeps all of the software opportunities for itself — and, of course, pursues software opportunities abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This understated the case: not only were Chinese companies allowed into the U.S. while U.S. companies remained locked out of China, Chinese attacks on U.S. tech companies were allowed by China’s censors, and in fact even augmented by the Great Firewall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is interesting. We worry about Chinese censorship of US content &lt;em&gt;in China&lt;/em&gt;, but we need to think of the reverse - US residents being censored within their own countries by a foreign government. This is especially true with the rise of tech startups with Chinese ownership (like TikTok) that have become popular globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This should raise serious concern in the United States and other Western countries: is it at all acceptable to have a social network that has a demonstrated willingness to censor content under the control of a country that has clearly different views on what constitutes free speech?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his personal conflict and the impetus for companies to choose morals over money:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am not particularly excited to write this article. My instinct is towards free trade, my affinity for Asia generally and Greater China specifically, my welfare enhanced by staying off China’s radar. And yet, for all that the idea of being a global citizen is an alluring concept and largely my lived experience, I find in situations like this that I am undoubtedly a child of the West. I do believe in the individual, in free speech, and in democracy, no matter how poorly practiced in the United States or elsewhere. And, in situations like this weekend, when values meet money, &lt;strong&gt;I worry just how many companies are capable of choosing the former?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the broader moral conflict:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest, shift, though, is a mindset one. First, the Internet is an amoral force that reduces friction, not an inevitable force for good. Second, sometimes different cultures simply have fundamentally different values. Third, if values are going to be preserved, they must be a leading factor in economic entanglement, not a trailing one. This is the point that Clinton got the most wrong: money, like tech, is amoral. If we insist it matters most our own morals will inevitably disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Business ideas are plentiful, and pursuing the wrong idea early-on can hamstring an entrepreneur’s efforts to launch a venture. An early misstep might even be the difference between becoming a successful entrepreneur and failure. Far from being a sign of weaknesses, sleep can serve as an early-stage aid to effectively evaluate the myriad business opportunities to pursue. Sleeping at the right times, such as the night before ideation and evaluation tasks, will improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

One of them is whether our online expressions should become immediately accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we publish something on the internet or tweet something to our followers, we immediately have an &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt; for those thoughts. That carries a sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are those that argue one shouldn’t concern themselves with the audience’s reaction - express the thought, act on them, see them through to their fullest extent. Life is an experiment and we need fearlessness to move society forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are those that argue that we &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; read the room. We cannot act with reckless abandon, and that people with leverage have an inherent responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a new problem, but the rise of influencer culture has magnified it and made it a mainstream issue. On one side, the most powerful person in the world is openly acting like an asshole on Twitter. On another side, people are feeling censored and attacked for their thoughts, and choosing to stay silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I see is intelligent people ignoring nuance, stuck in simplistic and uninformed mental models. People acting childishly, not understanding the leverage of their mediums and expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we’ll get to a place where we’ll be able to have decent social discourse and be able to grow together, but recognizing there are some just beginning that process. Perhaps that will just take time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We’re divided on so many fronts these days.

The definition of &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; is context specific, but most often it’s getting through a certain stage or getting ready for a future investment round, IPO, or another milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you raise too little, obviously that can handicap a companies ability to reach these goals. When raising too much, decision quality suffers - companies choose to do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; and prioritize less. This leads to a decline in output quality - be it in product, sales, or any business leading function. Startups often tend to spend what they raise, and being overcapitalized leads to saying yes to everything. Ofcourse, there is also the issue of over-valuing your company too early and the difficulty in raising another round in that situation. These and other issues are discussed in Mark Suster’s article from 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-raising-too-much-money-can-harm-your-startup-5adc112e1259&quot;&gt;Why Raising Too Much Money Can Harm Your Startup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, this applies not just to companies but to VC funds too. There weren’t that many examples of the counter argument before but now there’s Softbank’s Vision Fund, obviously an easy target these days. Excess capital clouds decision making, especially you’re in the sole business of deploying capital. It obviously affects the leading fund, but also other investors as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time when funds are awash with capital, Softbank is probably not the only outlier, and it’s only a matter of time until the hens come home to roost.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s generally good advice for companies to only raise the amount of capital for what’s absolutely necessary, and no more.

Maybe it’s the Sapiens effect, or just the amount of change that’s happening in the world. People want to know what’s next, and are looking to the past for answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Housel just published &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/three-big-things-the-most-important-forces-shaping-the-world/&quot;&gt;Three Big Things&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the best essays I’ve read recently on the topic of human history. It talks about how much of what we experience is a second, third and n-th order effect from some &lt;em&gt;big things&lt;/em&gt; that happened many years ago. Our modern society, for example, has largely been shaped by the events of World War II. Our current norms of personal finance, military strategy, and even civil rights are a result of the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three other big things that he discusses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A shift in demographics: Modern society is aging, people are living longer, working longer and having fewer kids. Immigrants will make their way to become the majority. These changes will be the most important factors shaping economic output in the upcoming decades. Want to know which economies will fare well? Observe the demographics.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The breaking point for wealth inequality: The wealth gap has never been worse, and there’s a cyclical trend at play - the pendulum will start to swing the other way as masses lose trust in economic and political systems. Morgan states, “…power is transitory. It shifts when those who don’t have it get so fed up that they bond together to gain enough influence to take it back. Never underestimate the power of a unified group of powerless people with a shared goal.” There will be a disruption in education, an increase in entrepreneurs, and new systems will be built along the way. It is a time to be optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Realizing the full potential of the internet: Access to information has changed the dynamics of how society works. Whether it’s solving a crime or finding a life partner, we are just scratching the surface of what’s possible when there’s an ever present information layer in our daily lives. While this will do a lot of good - more nuance in our understanding of the world, meritocracy that actually works - there are also some big, unsolved problems, such as the loss of privacy and spreading misinformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing about these trends is &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. That’s the whole point - we are so fascinated by the new that we miss out on the tidal waves that we are already on. This essay brings that into perspective so well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Human history seems to be a popular topic to write about these days.

&lt;p&gt;The system gives us comfort and a &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; of community. Everyone needs some kind of system they trust. We have built incredible political, religous, financial, medical and social systems in the name of progress. And along many dimensions, there &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been incredible progress. These systems all work together in a complex ways and often seem random when observed on short time scales. Taking a step back we see that most systems follow some kind of cyclical pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not all is well. Our systems have given us convenience, but in some places have removed our individualism. Ironically, they have given us many individual comforts, but made us collectively weaker in some places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, from where I stand, I’m observing a collective questioning of &lt;em&gt;all of our systems&lt;/em&gt;. While the action is not abnormal, the scale and scope of it is. People are losing trust in &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;, even though it’s not immediately obvious. And as a result, we’re seeing new systems being formed, and many of them are focused on helping people &lt;em&gt;own their destiny&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s owning your data, helping people become entrepreneurs, or changing the core units of monetary value - everything is being shaken up. In 10 years, we will look to this brief period as a critical juncture in human history.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">There is a time to trust the system and there’s a time to own your destiny.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">We Are All Going to Die</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20191003/we-are-all-going-to-die.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="We Are All Going to Die" /><published>2019-10-03T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-03T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20191003/we-are-all-going-to-die</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20191003/we-are-all-going-to-die.html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We are all going to die.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember when Jeremie Saunders said this during his talk at TEDxToronto from a few years ago. At the time, Jeremie was 29 years old, and was three months away from his &lt;em&gt;prescribed&lt;/em&gt; date of death due to Cystic Fibrosis. I can’t nearly do it justice, so here is the talk in full:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQniNh_6LOY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my favorite passages and quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On death and freedom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cystic Fibrosis is one of the best things that have happened to me. No longer does that sentence - “Cystic Fibrosis is a fatal genetic disease” - carry the weight of fear, rejection and anger. Instead it’s become this powerful source of inspiration - &lt;strong&gt;it drives me&lt;/strong&gt;. You see, my unavoidable fate opened up my eyes so wide that it fundamentally changed what it means to live day in and day out, moment to moment. Cystic Fibrosis has essentially given me the impetus to not only &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; my own mortality, but to &lt;em&gt;embrace&lt;/em&gt; my own mortality. With that comes this extraordinary sense of freedom. And I can take that freedom and sprinkle it into my life by living like nothing is unattainable. I can take that big scary concept of death and instead of fear it, Use it, as a tool to motivate myself to live life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On living fully, a quote from Mark Twain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremie is an incredible human and continues to share his message through his podcast Sickboy, about others who live with chronic or terminal illness, in order to destigmatize illness and build community for those who are sick.

&lt;p&gt;Antifragility is a concept that any entity actually gets stronger as a result of shock, or damage. It can be applied in business, medicine, systems design and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The antifragile is beyond the resilient or robust. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting thought exercise is how we can design our marketplaces to be antifragile by nature. The shocks can be the loss of entities on any side. For example, the loss of a supplier, or exodus of customers. Can a marketplace actually get better if a supplier is lost, or goes out of business? In decentralized marketplaces (like Teachable or Shopify), this is precisely what happens. It actually improves the quality bar of overall suppliers on the platform. Exodus of customers is similar in decentralized marketplaces - because the damage is limited to one supplier - and an exodus of customers can be a good sign that supplier shouldn’t be in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’re going to see a lot more of these types of decentralized marketplaces in the future and it will be good for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve had a few conversations recently about the concept of anti fragility as it applies to marketplaces.</summary></entry></feed>
