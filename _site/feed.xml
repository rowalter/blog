They want real margins that can sustain businesses in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred Wilson wrote an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://avc.com/2019/09/the-great-public-market-reckoning/&quot;&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; on this recently, and cited a post I’ve seen referred to often, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abovethecrowd.com/2011/05/24/all-revenue-is-not-created-equal-the-keys-to-the-10x-revenue-club/&quot;&gt;All Revenue is Not Created Equal&lt;/a&gt;. From the post is an excellent description of how valuation should differ based on the margins in a business:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is a huge difference between companies with high gross margins and those with lower gross margins. Using the DCF framework, you cannot generate much cash from a revenue stream that is saddled with large, variable costs. As a result, lower gross margin companies will trade a highly discounted price/revenue multiples. All things being equal, gross margin percentage should have a direct impact on price/revenue multiple, as there will obviously be more gross margin dollars to contribute to free cash flow. Journalists who quickly apply 10x multiples to all private companies should at the very least consider gross margin levels in their analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great post on this topic, that I’ve referred to in the past as well, is Tren Wilson’s post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://25iq.com/2017/02/04/gross-margin-for-fun-and-profit-involves-beer-and-music-streaming/&quot;&gt;Gross Margin for Fun and Profit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">As more tech IPO’s tank, it’s clear that public market investors are not reacting well to the potential of the hottest companies in tech today.

This post is a set of highly disconnected points I want to make in that essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Inherently software is an infinitely moldable, interactive, and updateable object.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software is plastic. It has an infinite creative space, and will soon become everything. When that happens, it will also become &lt;em&gt;invisible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AI helps software create patterns - patterns that help us see, hear, and create.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who make software need to deeply understand the spoken and unspoken needs of the people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who make software must accept both the first and second order effects of what they are creating, especially given how easy it is to distribute and get people’s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software is eating the world - first by &lt;em&gt;modelling it&lt;/em&gt;, then by creating something that only exist only in software. This is a consistent pattern that applies in many scenarios and industries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software is becoming closer to us. We are already wearing software, driving software, and living in software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Software is starting to solve some higher order human functions - we learn, meditate, and empathize with software. But we don’t have software-native ways to do those things, yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What happens when software has finished eating the world? What do we have to watch out for? Technologists love to extrapolate potential but software’s place in society will likely be more balanced and neutral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This is how software is eating the world from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the tactics he mentioned was activating social networks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Social networks have been largely underutilized in fintech thus far. But existing social bonds can be a powerful tool used to encourage saving and extend credit—ROSCAs are an age-old (offline) example. Looking ahead, a16z general partner Connie Chan recently wrote about the use of WhatsApp and WeChat groups in China to facilitate product experiences in travel, shopping, fitness, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two layers to social finance. One leans on the dynamics in which money moves between people. This encompasses everything from peer to peer transfers to shared savings pools (the ROSCAs referred to above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is simply adding a social layer on top of the current financial services, that encourages people to be more open about matters of money. This includes safe spaces to ask others about money (Reddit’s finance forums, for example - although I wouldn’t broadly classify Reddit as a safe space), but also things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetcleo.com/&quot;&gt;cheeky financial advice chat bots&lt;/a&gt; that are fun to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our relationships with money are complicated, and many seek social validation to make sure they’re on the right track. For most, being a part of the right pack is exactly what they need. Financial advisors provide this ability but there’s so much more room for experimentation here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yesterday Anish Acharya published this post entitled Five Ways Fintech Companies can find Customers.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Zone To Win</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190924/zone-to-win.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Zone To Win" /><published>2019-09-24T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-24T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190924/zone-to-win</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190924/zone-to-win.html">&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Moore, author of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm&quot;&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, was in Toronto today giving a talk about his new book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zonetowin.com/&quot;&gt;Zone to Win&lt;/a&gt;. It details a framework for how established enterprises can compete amongst the threat of disruptive innovations. In it, he details 4 “zones” of work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Performance Zone, where the key metric is to make the number. It consists of the sales organizations accountable for bookings and the product and service organizations accountable for revenue—and no one else.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Productivity Zone, where success means delivering efficient systems and effective programs while ensuring all operations are regulatory compliant. Virtually everyone who is not directly accountable for a booking or revenue number works here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Incubation Zone, where the objective is to make, market, and sell products and services that are highly disruptive to the status quo. These efforts are deliberately kept sequestered from the prior two zones to speed cycle time, embrace innovation, and take risk. Success here consists of creating viable businesses in net new uncorrelated categories that can be scaled to material size.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The Transformation Zone, where success equates either to driving an incubated business to material scale or fending off a direct attack on a core business model. In either case an initiative in this zone takes priority over all activities in the other three zones, and they must make whatever adjustments necessary to accommodate it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first 3 are fairly well understood. “Performance” and “Productivity” are relevant to sustaining innovation - either extracting maximum value from a market, or for enabling functions. The Incubation zone efforts are the lab-type efforts that exist in almost every enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to say that big companies can’t innovate isn’t really true. Most big companies work well in Zone 1 and 2. They also invest in Zone 3, to address the disruptive forces themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, he highlighted cases from 56 companies that were once market leaders, all had innovation labs, but never were able to counter the disruptive forces working against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason, in all those organizations, was the lack of a “transformation” zone type effort. In this zone, companies move into &lt;em&gt;war time&lt;/em&gt; mode to ensure that the successful incubated projects are actualized into the rest of the company. Most companies fail at this - even successful incubated projects either struggle to integrate with the rest of the organization / product line. In this zone, everyone in the organization needs to be &lt;em&gt;focused&lt;/em&gt; on making this transformation successful, which can sometimes mean sacrificing short term revenue targets for revenue growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few examples are Apple’s focus on the iPod (when the Mac was making it the most money), and Microsoft’s recent shift to cloud computing (so dramatic that there’s no longer a Windows division in the company).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Geoffrey Moore, author of Crossing the Chasm, was in Toronto today giving a talk about his new book, Zone to Win.

&lt;p&gt;This made me think about some of the cycles that modern society is seemingly stuck in. Some that are top of mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The daily 9-5 cycle, created as a by-product of the industrial revolution but no longer relevant in a knowledge economy. Within this is also the daily commute cycle, a 2-3 hour block of lost productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cycle of higher education as the only path to unlock success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cycle of reactive, symptom-focused care perpetuated by the modern medical industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some are norms that have been perfected for years for us to inherit. But, the internet has given us infrastructure to pass information and value in real time, so it’s time to apply first-principles thinking and think of the best solutions to these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was listening to The Hustler’s Guide to Gettin’ Paid, and the CEO of Earnin was talking about how a alarming 40% of American’s don’t have access to $400 if they needed it for an unexpected expense.

It’s a behind-the-scenes look at Bill’s life - focusing on his work at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, but also covers his childhood, his work at Microsoft, reading habits and much more. It’s pretty fascinating, and I will probably watch it a few times. This is a post of a few things I took away from the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Gates is a first principles thinker.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When designing the next generation &lt;em&gt;toilet&lt;/em&gt;, he approaches the problem with a few unchangable restrictions. In this case, it’s the current conditions of the places where these toilets are needed the most - especially the lack of electricity and running water. The foundation ran a contest to encourage innovation around a toilet that doesn’t require running water, access to electricity, and where the byproduct can be re-used instead of being dumped into rivers and lakes. These next generation toilets are being produced and deployed around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill Gates uses mental models for everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Melinda Gates says it best - “[Bill] makes a framework in his mind, and then starts slotting in the information. If something doesn’t line up, he gets very frustrated.” He uses frameworks to understand complex topics and then devours as much information as he can to complete that model. Mental models create simple structures to understand the real world, which are essential to linking the facts together. I’m guessing that’s why he’s most often the smartest guy in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many other learnings - on the habits he’s formed to devour and retain information, his sense of competition, and also the incredible privelege that allowed for him to explore his interests throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Bill Gates documentary series was released on Netflix on Friday.
