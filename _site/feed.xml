&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most people now believe the best “risky investments” will continue to be equity and equity-like investments, such as leveraged private equity, leveraged real estate, and venture capital, and this is especially true when central banks are reflating. As a result, the world is leveraged long, holding assets that have low real and nominal expected returns that are also providing historically low returns relative to cash returns (because of the enormous amount of money that has been pumped into the hands of investors by central banks and because of other economic forces that are making companies flush with cash). I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold. Additionally, for reasons I will explain in the near future, most investors are underweighted in such assets, meaning that if they just wanted to have a better balanced portfolio to reduce risk, they would have more of this sort of asset. For this reason, I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one’s portfolio. I will soon send out an explanation of why I believe that gold is an effective portfolio diversifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Long Tail argues that more value exists by aggregating all the small niches together than in the small group of hit products or content. By this theory Youtube ultimately has more lasting value than Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sparked another discussion on the different ways technology companies can play a role in aggregating the long tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is driven by customer demand - in the case of content, this is driven by &lt;em&gt;what audiences want&lt;/em&gt;. This approach focuses on audience desires for free access, amazing discovery experiences and opportunities to connect with each other. There’s a network effect which improves recommendations that’s created when other audience members join. In this approach, the supply side - creators - often do whatever it takes to conform to what audiences want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is supply focused - to help every creator &lt;em&gt;become as successful as they can be&lt;/em&gt;. This is where the customer is the creator and the product is a set of utilities to help them build audiences and make money from their craft. In this world, creators are empowered to find the channels that work for them vs. being beholden to any one single channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both can yield massive amounts of enterprise value and can both help the Long Tail become successful, but are polar opposite in the type of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">We had a really great discussion today about The Long Tail at Wattpad’s monthly product book club.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">On Context Switching and Calendars</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190714/calendars-context-switching.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On Context Switching and Calendars" /><published>2019-07-14T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-14T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190714/calendars-context-switching</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190714/calendars-context-switching.html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about my frustration with mobile calendar apps before. The most annoying part of dealing with calendars on a mobile device is context switching between communication apps (chat, email) and calendars (for availability). It’s an experience that could be solved by integrating communication features like chat directly within a calendar app itself. Every event would open to a chat message between attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would do a number of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chat and email would be freed of the clutter of coordination messages. The back and forth to coordinate events is a huge reason events don’t happen at all. This friction is bad enough that it prevents real world social interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would be easier to refer back to conversations and documents related to the event itself, and create a forum to review/rate event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would give calendars a natural network effect - more people on this app would add value to everyone else on the platform in your social circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calendars are an inherently social product that we are all forced to play in single player mode - just because of lack of options. Hoping this changes soon and Google/Apple fixes this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I’ve written about my frustration with mobile calendar apps before.

&lt;p&gt;Parenting takes you back to your own childhood, and I’ve often thought how I would even come close to recreating this experience for our family. Relocation seems like such a momentous challenge of finding a new home, livelihood and social support system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, what if that process wasn’t so difficult? What if you could painlessly coordinate the entire process of finding a new home and job in a new country, and connect with like minded people to build a support system? This sounds like ultra fringe behaviour but we all have friends that have moved to a different country just to experience a different life for a few years. It could become more normal much the same way renting your house to strangers is on Airbnb, or getting into a strangers car on Lyft or Uber. I’d like to imagine a future in which this is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Travel has always been a part of my personal narrative.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This month, officials in Los Angeles, California, are expected to approve a deal that would make solar power cheaper than ever while also addressing its chief flaw: It works only when the sun shines. The deal calls for a huge solar farm backed up by one of the world’s largest batteries. It would provide 7% of the city’s electricity beginning in 2023 at a cost of 1.997 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for the solar power and 1.3 cents per kWh for the battery. That’s cheaper than any power generated with fossil fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the power of technology cost curves. Incremental improvements slowly drive down costs of new technology - often while incumbents write off new entrants as not being good/fast/cheap enough. Soon after better tech becomes &lt;em&gt;cheaper&lt;/em&gt; than the alternative, change happens fast and incumbents get displaced.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">From Science Mag on the progress of solar technology:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">No Coders</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190711/nocoders.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="No Coders" /><published>2019-07-11T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-11T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190711/nocoders</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190711/nocoders.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nocode.tech/&quot;&gt;‘No Code’&lt;/a&gt; is a movement that enables non-technical entrepreneurs to create real, working digital products.

&lt;p&gt;A marketplace is a system, and building one from scratch requires a keen sense of equilibrium on all sides. If you have too much supply, your early suppliers will leave for lack of opportunity. If demand outstrips supply, you will be left with unhappy customers (first impressions are difficult to change, although not impossible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect is timing to make adjustments. In the early stage, you have to constantly tune and tweak your marketplace so that everyone is happy - quickly osscilating to resolve issues to help suppliers be successful and make customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds obvious but every initiative (project, feature, task) should have direct impact on your current marketplace. Avoid building something that will only have &lt;em&gt;second order impact&lt;/em&gt; without any meaningful changes to the &lt;em&gt;current market&lt;/em&gt;. Ask yourself - if this was built tomorrow, would our marketplace immediately change? If the answer is no, reconsider the level of investment. We buy the luxury of time when things are more established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are ofcourse many ways of maintaining equilibrium early. The most sustainable is to onboard early users slowly so that maintaining equilibrium is never a huge issue. Making sure you have a good feedback channel is critical during this time too. The other approach is to ensure your ability to iterate on changes is rapid enough to address any rising issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Some thoughts on how systems thinking can be applied to marketplace development in early stages:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shape Up</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190710/shape-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shape Up" /><published>2019-07-10T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-07-10T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190710/shape-up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190710/shape-up.html">&lt;p&gt;Another book from the crew at Basecamp - this one called &lt;a href=&quot;https://basecamp.com/shapeup/&quot;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt;, and details their development process with illustrations.

&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of the world of gaming and virtual currencies. In-app purchases and subscriptions are often mapped to coins, passes, candy and other currencies that can be redeemed in an app. Once they have been translated into these virtual currencies, we can similarly innovate on different business models that might work best in a specific scenario. For example, we can use the subscription API to give users coins every month (instead of simple access), and then use those coins to purchase content or pay other users in an app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This full capability (especially that to pay users with coins) isn’t yet possible with the In-app purchase API’s provided by Apple and Google. But ultimately, the behaviours that have a lot of traction will then get adopted into those platform API’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of Facebook - the world’s largest social network - as a game, the Libra cryptocurrency is their virtual good. Difference being that they’re not the only ones controlling it. It has value pegged to real currency, can be used to trade goods and services, and can be traded in for other currencies on different exchanges. More so, when another app uses Libra, it creates network effect for that currency and the utility value increases for users of Libra. Already, Uber, Ebay, Lyft, Spotify and others have joined. More mature games have multiple currencies running in parallel, much in the same way there are hundreds of possible cryptocurrencies to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s modelling our personalities and relationships.
It’s modelling how we tell stories through words, music, and video and games. 
It’s modelling our money and how we interact with it.
It’s modelling how we trust and look for social proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now wear our software, live, breathe and sleep in it. We can almost touch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But software is imperfect: the map is not the territory. Models often over simplify and leave out the niches and edge cases, often excluding people without intending. It’s the job of the designers and builders to make sure that doesn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A model is a simulation, and through that simulation we can create exponential outcomes. When those stay in the software space, they seem harmless. But when you reach a certain scale, that simulation can have unintended real-world effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I don’t like to think of software as eating the world; rather just modelling it.</summary></entry></feed>
