&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;At the end of each work day, write down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow. Do not write down more than six tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Prioritize those six items in order of their true importance.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;When you arrive tomorrow, concentrate only on the first task. Work until the first task is finished before moving on to the second task.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Approach the rest of your list in the same fashion. At the end of the day, move any unfinished items to a new list of six tasks for the following day.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Repeat this process every working day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an app that makes this easier, appropriately named &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ivy-stress-free-to-do-lists/id1458049415?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8&quot;&gt;Ivy&lt;/a&gt;. I really appreciate the retrospective graphs. A few months ago I started using a simpler productivity system - weekly planning and retrospectives. For the latter, I look at what I accomplished vs. what I committed to. Retrospectives highlight my mistakes, which I try to avoid in my next round of planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today I learned of a simple productivity technique called the Ivy Lee method, created in 2018 but still relevant.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Collision Day 1 Retrospective</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/20190521/collision-day-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Collision Day 1 Retrospective" /><published>2019-05-21T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-05-21T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/20190521/collision-day-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/20190521/collision-day-1.html">&lt;p&gt;Today was the first day of Collision. There was so much happening on the floor, and it was really great to see Toronto as the centre of the Tech universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some general themes I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech is dealing with Trust issues. More so, the lack thereof. Companies are operating in environments where trust is no longer implied but an earned currency. This came up in many contexts - discussions about social media companies and their role in distributing trusted news, or millennials relationship with traditional banks. Also amongst ourselves in the tech community- especially towards the central powers of FANG.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workforces on demand especially for engineering talent. Hiring is the biggest issue facing most startups and can be the main reason why many don’t get off the ground. There are a number of startups solving this problem especially for the early stage of shipping a V1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technology and higher order problems. I’m biased because I’m also interested in this space. I saw a number of really interesting startups on the floor working on a range of solutions to psychological and social issues - everything from mental health to creating empathy through software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was overwhelmed with the first day, perhaps because I was surprised at how much is happening. I’m looking forward to seeing what themes emerge in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today was the first day of Collision.

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most investors are newbies and rely on sites like Investopedia regularly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most investors over follow the market and make short term decisions for quick rewards (not a good move)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understanding investor intent is the strongest leading indicator of investment. Investopedia is a great source of this information.&lt;/li&gt;

It was the most successful show in television history. Some facts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The series premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The series has received 47 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, and 2018.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first season averaged 9.3 million viewers per episode. By season 7 it was 32.8 million. Season 8 numbers aren’t out yet but I wouldn’t be surprised if it touched 40M or more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoT was a cultural phenomenon by all measures. It’s the kind of story universe that can turn into books, TV shows, movies and amusement parks. The show might be done but I don’t think we’re done with these characters just yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">After 8 seasons, Game of Thrones is over.

More specifically, what led to Facebook being weaponized for all sorts of bad things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the specifics of the Facebook situation, I believe it comes down to a few broader factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; than most technology. We need to recognize software has almost unlimited surface area - which explains how it’s “eating the world”. Software, especially internet software, has almost infinite leverage. A piece of code written in a basement can produce real world outcomes across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, there are no real regulations on what is allowed vs not. It was hard to think of the potential of internet software, let alone how to prevent any bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, ‘irresponsible’ progress continues to be celebrated. Whether it’s blitzscaling, ignoring local laws, or simply moving fast and breaking things - the technology industry wears irresponsibility as a badge of honor. Without any regulation, decisions are made with a singular lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we’re only starting to see the downsides of not building software responsibly, and there doesn’t seem to be a widely held solution yet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I was talking to someone recently about Facebook and responsible technology.

It explains the concept and provides some real world strategies to create environments of deep work in your day. They focus on intentionality of the structure. In the section about &lt;a href=&quot;https://doist.com/blog/complete-guide-to-deep-work/#Build_a_Deep_Work_Routine&quot;&gt;how to build a deep work routine&lt;/a&gt;, it mentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Practicing intention with your time and considering when you’ll fit in periods of focus is an important part of succeeding with a deep work habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four elements of that are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt; - A space that’s conducive to deep work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt; - A period of time that works for you (starting small then increasing over time as you build your “deep work muscle”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure&lt;/strong&gt; - The rules for the session - whether its digital distractions or how you will measure success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt; - What’s required to help create the environment - music, food, etc. This will be learned over time.&lt;/li&gt;

When an individual or family migrates to a different country, they bring those mental models with them. This can include, for example, different expectations around loan repayment or how money is pooled in an atomic family. All aspects of personal finance are affected - earning, borrowing, budgeting, saving, investing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowhere is this more pronounced than Canada - a country that is soon to be 50% immigrants in a few years. And yet, the financial products available to most Canadians are not geared  towards these unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes extra complicated with newer generations that are raised in Canada but also have cultural and familial obligations to fulfill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think by considering the unique needs of immigrant families and cultures, financial service providers will benefit &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes it’s just a  knowledge asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s impossible not to look outside a city especially in a competitive hiring environment like today. Remote-only organizations are becoming more common, and companies have to start building cultures where remote workers can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean to do business in a global talent pool? Some considerations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hiring becomes both easier and more difficult. Finding the best people globally means there’s greater space for meritocracy vs privelege. But, finding the right person is now the proverbial needle in a haystack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping create team dynamics in a global talent pool is extremely difficult. This is a common challenge with remote work. Individuals can feel isolated and teams may not feel as cohesive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s an additional overhead investment to make remote successful. This can include operational issues like knowledge management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A global talent pool affects all parts of a company system - there’s great potential when it can work, but it won’t come without proactive investment. For many, that may be too tough a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Restricting talent to a local candidate pool isn’t a sustainable way to build a company.
