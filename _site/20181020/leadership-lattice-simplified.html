  <h2>The Leadership Lattice, Simplified</h2>
  

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I’ve recently been writing about the Leadership Lattice - a framework for leadership development and learning. This post is an attempt to describe the lattice in the simplest possible terms.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of leadership advice these days - there are thousands of books, articles and podcasts. Taking it all in can be daunting, and applying it is even more difficult.</p>

<p>All too often, recency bias causes us to apply a technique that we have just read about. This is amplified in today’s startup ecosystem where advice is aplenty and context is minimal.</p>

<p>The concept of building a latticework is a general learning technique - instead of trying to learn things in isolation, we should attempt to hang them onto a latticework of theory that helps to connect it all together.</p>

<p>In the context of leadership, the latticework is a simple conceptual structure of how companies work. I will also caveat this is about leadership in a private enterprise vs government.</p>

<p>This conceptual structure starts with a simple description of <em>what a company is</em>: a collective of individuals in some commercial [or industrial] enterprise.</p>

<p>So, the lattice is simply a breakdown of this into interconnected components that need to be managed: the leader, individuals, systems of organization (teams), the products and services offered in market, and the collective impact of the company.</p>

<p>The lattice shows the range of accountability for a leader - they have to manage everything from themselves to the collective impact of their organization. Leaders choose to focus on areas depending on their areas of strength - some leaders often spend time in organizational systems, others in the application domain focused on products and markets.</p>

<p>The lattice is based on a first principles approach to leadership based on <em>how companies work</em> - and as such is just as much a framework of company building. As I mentioned in an <a href="/20181013/systems-of-impact.html">earlier post</a> - leadership development and company building are conceptually connected.</p>

<p>In future posts, I’ll be <em>testing</em> the lattice with real advice - books and articles that I’ve found helpful, and how they have helped to develop my own leadership lattice.</p>
