I had lunch with a founder CEO today and our conversation got to the topic of CEO anxiety.


Our definition of success for a company is increasing. 

The power law of capitalism
Venture capital following the money 




Working at a time of transformative change - incredible opportunities and responsibilities 

Founder Anxiety 
Toxic masculinity 
Hard things about hard things - the prevailing advice is to "suck it up"

Making change is contrarian and not easy by design 

The perception of progress is flawed - victories are not always what they seem, and neither are the failures 

Standards of what is growth is increasing, as are the standards of acceleration. 

Internet has a way of accelerating perceptions of reality - like the world is changing at an even faster pace. look at those S CURVES. 

We are also in an age of self awareness and measurement - there's a growing sense of not measuring up.
