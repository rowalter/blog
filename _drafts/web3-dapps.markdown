* Building Decentralized Services - In this final week, I'll examine the current state of the web3 development stack, with a particular emphasis of how developers today need to shift their thinking in a world of decentralized development.

Incentives (from [Fat Protocols](http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols)):
> When a token appreciates in value, it draws the attention of early speculators, developers and entrepreneurs. They become stakeholders in the protocol itself and are financially invested in its success. Then some of these early adopters, perhaps financed in part by the profits of getting in at the start, build products and services around the protocol, recognizing that its success would further increase the value of their tokens. Then some of these become successful and bring in new users to the network and perhaps VCs and other kinds of investors. This further increases the value of the tokens, which draws more attention from more entrepreneurs, which leads to more applications, and so on.
