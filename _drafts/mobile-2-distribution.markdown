Is the web Vs App debate really over? 

Biggest barrier to mobile distribution is friction of installing apps. 

Some things that could change current dynamics:

App Stores become like browsers 
- App previews
- Allow more control of app pages 
- Make download invisible to users

React Native 
- it allows apps and components of apps to be installed on the fly. 
- expo can be the new browser

Messaging apps build in app development environments 
- similar to wechat 
- apps are recommended organically

Already happening?

Next wave of mobile distribution will be powered on top of other apps; messaging will power app distribution. (already happened in China, will happen here)
