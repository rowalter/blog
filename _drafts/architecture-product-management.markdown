I've always been interested in architecture. Before I decided to study engineering, I always thought I'd eventually try to become an architect.

While I haven't pursued that path, it's interesting that I've gone down a similar path in the digital world. There are a lot of common principles in the worlds of Product Management and Architecture.

Architecture is the art and science of designing buildings.

Form follows function

Form follows function is a principle associated with 20th-century modernist architecture and industrial design which says that the shape of a building or object should primarily relate to its intended function or purpose.

The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is De architectura, by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early 1st century AD.[8] According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitas, utilitas, venustas, commonly known by the original translation – firmness, commodity and delight. An equivalent in modern English would be:

Durability – a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition.
Utility – it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used.
Beauty – it should be aesthetically pleasing.

Urban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns and villages.
