There's a new wave of software that is creating an unbundled rival to the trio of Google's enterprise software - Docs, Sheets and Slides. 

Airtable is building the new spreadsheet.
Notion is building the new document / wiki.
RealtimeBoard is building a collaborative whiteboard.
Prezi is building the next generation presentation.
Slack is ofcourse disrupting email with chat.

Some common properties of these apps:
- **Web and Mobile Native / The Dying "File" Model** - There is no model of files in any of these products. Google Docs retains that model, and is largely a version of Microsoft office suite brought online. It provides Drive as a management layer on top of all these files. These apps are the web and mobile native version of documents and spreadsheets - they do not assume a world in which word, excel or any other non-web document existed prior.

- **Richer Documents** - This software 
- Better integrations
- Realtime collaboration
