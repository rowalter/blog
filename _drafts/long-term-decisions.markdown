Today I want to cover some of the frameworks that I have collected for planning on longer time scales. An example of this is a major job or career change.

Some general notes on long term planning:
* These decisions require time and reflection. If possible, they shouldn't be applied in a rush because most are classic [Type 1 decisions](https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-on-type-1-and-type-2-decisions-2016-4) in that they are not easily reversible.
* These decisions provide a sense of _long term purpose_, which then liberates us to focus and make the most of every day.
* Using multiple frameworks is recommended. Each one provides a different perspective through which to examine the future.

Some of these are general decision making frameworks and can be applied outside the context of long term personal planning.
