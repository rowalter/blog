There are a few stories that I recount frequently - my upbringing, my career journey, and my trials and tribulations with immigration.

Since I wrote about the first in a post a few weeks ago, I thought I'd write a post about the other two as well.


Personal career story
- coops (next: immigration challenges)
- tira (next: curious about music)
- big companies (next: back to startup)
- Wattpad

Common threads:
Nothing was planned, lots of unpredictability, said yes to a bunch of opportunities
Became curious and then committed for a certain time period
Relationships over everything
Don't rush it - just getting started
