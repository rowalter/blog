Notes:

- What tokens are
- How the immutability of the blockchain enables tokens
- How tokens are digital ownership
- Given this is a part of the protocol, the notion of scarcity in asset is part of the protocol, money is now a native function of the internet
- MONEY VS TOKENS, how money is a perverse incentive, and not tied to the value of what's being created

- ledger lives across multiple computers. Crypto functions - hashes etc - make it possible for all the computers to have the same record of the data without any central parties. But it's not magic - those computers still have to use their compute power to verify transactions on the chain. Tokens provide incentive for that 

* Value and Digital Ownership - I'll examine the how value is built on the incorruptibility promise of the blockchain. This gives rise to transfer and ownership of digital assets (fungible and non-fungible). In this week, I'll also look at how the blockchain is making money a "native function of the internet".


> Historically the only way to make money from a protocol was to create software that implemented it and then try to sell this software (or more recently to host it). Since the creation of this software (e.g. web server/browser) is a separate act many of the researchers who have created some of the most successful protocols in use today have had little direct financial gain. With tokens, however, the creators of a protocol can “monetize” it directly and will in fact benefit more as others build businesses on top of that protocol.


In this article about [Crypto Tokens](https://medium.com/@cdixon/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design-e600975be2ef), Chris Dixon discusses how they enable the funding of operating open services.
