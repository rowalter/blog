A new OS for work - conversation centric workflow 

A new way to build enterprise product. SASS apps - user model, distribution dynamics. Currently Apps are not as functional but slowly building towards it. 

A new professional network. Your Slack workspaces like Reddit.

Slack is a new way of working - inside a conversation. 

Wave 1 - pc apps / stand-alone 
Wave 2- web apps -  
Wave 3 - 

Web products provide utility first then conversation. Slack is about the reverse. 

More than chat - flexible user model, app distribution platform. 

Gives consumer type distribution inside the enterprise. 

-- Past Notes

Slack is a really interesting company to watch. Some notes on their assets and opportunities.

One of Slack's most valuable assets is their team/channel/user permission data.

Shared channels extend the model. Slack gets more data about how individuals, teams and companies work. 

Communication is the obvious win, but the entire world of SaaS benefits.

So many SaaS apps have a team / user permission model. It feels like Slack is going to own that eventually.

One of the biggest impacts 

Slack is a payments platform away from upending the entire world of SaaS.

Add to that the Slack app directory which gives incredible distribution (it's now one-click away in Desktop).

SaaS companies that are Slack-first will win.
More and more work will continue to happen in Slack.
Their biggest competitor is the Browser, where the other work happens.
Customer success teams should be rejoicing.
