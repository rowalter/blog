a manifesto of self improvement

My story
- Anxiety 
- Feelings of inadequacy 

Why it's important:
- the freedom of looking within 
- creates a commitment to learning 
- helps you enjoy life - be more forgiving to yourself 

How to do it: 
- Attitude - Intentionality and how everything is an investment 
- Living in a learning loop - frameworks for decisions execution and learning 
- Habit based thinking 
- Baselining current behaviours - know who you are 

What happens 
- reduces anxiety
- provides clarity of thought 
- competing with yourself
