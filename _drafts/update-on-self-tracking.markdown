Time Tracking for the last 30 days.

Time trends:
- Parenting has taken role of full time job
- bad habit trends reducing
- highlights time is zero sum game
- 30 minute increments create a natural pause for re-evaluating how i'm using time. Makes sure that waste doesn't exceed that. 
- Need to figure our Best times for each Habit. Eg. Writing in the evening as a means of reflection, reading before bed. 
- trends are easy to notice and fix
- Habit time trends 


Task trends
- overcommitment at same rate
- valley after peaks
- need better structure for task size
