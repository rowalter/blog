Making software and delivering it to users is an everchanging set of crafts. While some change happens suddenly, most is gradual and trends are observable. 

Some happens suddenly and is unpredictable - like new platform launches. For the most part, the changes are gradual as new technology is adopted.

1. **Merging interface design and development** - The craft of design and development are becoming indistinguishable. Development has abstracted away complexity so it's easier to get started building an app or website - this is a truism, because all software development is abstraction. What is interesting is design tools adopting development workflows - and even underlying technology (like Framer.js adopting React). We are at the point where a design prototype can _almost_ become a launchable app to test with real users. Some complexity still exists in connecting a data layer. It should easy to connect a design prototype to a real database, the structure of which is inferred by the prototype itself.

2. **Machine learning will enable more forms of human input, and better ** - 


3. Mobile distribution will change with improvements at the network / metal layer. 

There is innovation happening at all levels of the computing stack. When we write software, it operates on a complex system that is always evolving. A new capability at one layer of the stack will open up possibilities in the layers above. As an example - fast network speeds enabled new application capabilities like video calling.

The next 5 years

1. Design and boilerplate MVC development will converge



Because of closed platforms, mobile developers cannot start by decomposing software like web developers have been able to do. They will have to start from but user-first (starting at a concept and working forwards).

2. ML will become part of every development stack

Most apps collect or present some form of data from users.
Data collected > Stored in DB > Interpreted 
It will be easier for every developer to take a pre-trained ML model and insert it into their app. ML models will update like software version updates. 

3. 



This will _further_ increase the importance of good distribution. https://a16z.com/2018/07/20/after-product-market-fit-marc-andreessen-elad-gil/





A few signals along this path:
- Framer.js - the prototyping tool - is now powered by React, one of the most popular Javascript libraries. React has a component-centric architecture that is used on the web and in mobile apps.



There is a Todo app for every use - more people are feeling comfortable enough building software just for their needs. The notion of buying "the shape of the thing they want"
