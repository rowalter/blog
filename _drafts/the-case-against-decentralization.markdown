As part of a critical thinking exercise, thought it would be useful to create a case against Web 3. 

How can crypto fail:
- Scalability never reached to a point where it becomes better than centralized alternative
- Market dynamics get used wrongly or abused, - already happening in some pockets and this will likely happen more
- Blockchain breaks down in terms of security  - it actually becomes insecure
- Recentralization happens in some form
- Blockchain innovation stops (can happen for many reasons) 
- incumbent Internet giants can somehow thwart or slow down its progress - legal action etc.
