For the last few weeks I've been writing about using lattice as a learning framework for management and leadership. In it, I describe the layers of the lattice as "domains" of responsibility.

* Self domain, concerned with managing yourself as a leader
* Individual Domain, concerned with people management at an individual level 
* Organization Domain, concerned with how people organize to work together
* Application Domain: concerned with the specific outputs and outcomes of an organization. 
* Impact Domain, concerned with the broader impacts of the organization's collective output

These can be seen as concentric circles.

Each one of these layers are best described as **interdependent systems** within a company. Individuals are the atomic unit within those systems. 

Companies are the collection of these systems, and management at each layer is about understanding and building the best version of them. 

This is done by investing in - growing the individuals themselves, understanding the flywheels and feedback loops of the systems, the practices that go into building and maintaining them, and the frameworks that can be used to do that.
