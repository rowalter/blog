I was going to simply edit the original Leadership Lattice post for this, but decided to write it out separately to clarify my thinking. 

For the last few weeks I've been writing about a lattice as a learning framework for management and leadership. In it, I describe the layers of the lattice as "domains" of responsibility like individual, organizations, etc. However - the term domain isn't the best descriptor. 

Each one of these layers are best described as **interdependent systems** within a company. Individuals are the atomic unit within those systems. 

Companies are the collection of these systems, and management at each layer is about understanding and building the best version of them. This is done by investing in - growing the individuals themselves, understanding the flywheels and feedback loops of the systems, the practices that go into building and maintaining them, and the frameworks that can be used to do that. 

As such, I'll be using the systems vs domain terminology going forward.
