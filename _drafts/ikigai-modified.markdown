The modified ikigai is a simplified version of the Ikigai. 

I arrived at this independently a number of years ago, and the Ikigai framework really completed my thinking.

What I love to do (Interest)
What I'm good at (Expertise)

What the world needs (Mission)
What people Want (Opportunity)

Top is inward looking, Bottom is outward. 
One side is Pragmatic, Another is Idealistic
